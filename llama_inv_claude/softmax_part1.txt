Based on the given function and the template, here's the loop invariant:

def invariant(i: int, input: List[int], max_pos: int, max_val: int) -> bool:
    return i >= 1 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))

This invariant captures the following properties:
1. The valid range of the loop index `i` is from 1 to `max_pos`.
2. At each iteration, `max_val` is equal to the maximum value of the slice of `input` from index 0 to `i`.

This invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop, maintains its truth throughout the loop iterations, and establishes the desired postcondition when the loop terminates.
