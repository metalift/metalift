["I apologize for the previous failures. To generate a more suitable solution, could you please provide more details about the `normal_blend_f` function? Specifically, I need to know:\n\n1. What is the desired behavior of `normal_blend_f`? What mathematical operation or formula should it implement?\n2. What are the expected input types and lengths for `base`, `active`, and `opacity`?\n3. What is the expected output type and length of the function?\n4. How should out-of-range values during the blending process be handled (e.g., clamping or raising errors)?\n5. Any specific edge cases or requirements for the `normal_blend_f` function?\n\nWith this information, I can generate a more accurate and appropriate solution for the `normal_blend_f` function."]
