    "The given `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nHere, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply a function (in this case, `min`) element-wise to two matrices. This is equivalent to the original C++ function, which iterates over the elements of the `base` and `active` matrices and selects the smaller value for each pair of corresponding elements.",
