    "In Python, we can accomplish the same task using the provided set of functions. Essentially, we are blending the 'base' and 'active' images based on a threshold determined by the 'opacity' and 'rand_cons' parameters. We use the 'matrix_selection_two_args' function to accomplish this. Our selection function will be a lambda function that uses the logic from the original C++ function.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    threshold = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) / 100\n    selection_func = lambda x, y: y if opacity - threshold >= 0 else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, selection_func)\n```\n\nNote: This python code relies on that the dimensions of base and active are the same and the lambda function is applied element-wise. The rand_cons variable is also assumed to be given in percentage terms and is converted to a ratio in code. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to be aware that rand_cons here is not going to generate a new random value for each pixel like in the original C++ code. Python code with similar functionality would violate the constraints from the problem, which restricts us to only use the provided function set. In Python, the rand_cons is applied uniformly across all pixels, while in the original C++, a new rand_val is generated for each pixel. The equivalent functionality in Python would need usage of either a function for generating random values or a matrix of rand_cons values, neither of which are available in the provided function set."
