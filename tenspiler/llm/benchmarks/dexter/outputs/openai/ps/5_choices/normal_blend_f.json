    "Here is how you can rewrite the given `test` C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    out = vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n    return out\n```\n\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function. Both functions take two vectors (base and active) and a scalar (opacity), and return a new vector where each element i is computed as the weighted sum of the corresponding elements in the base and active vectors, with weights given by opacity and (1-opacity) respectively.\n  \nIn more detail, `vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)` and `vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)` each return a new vector where each element is the product of opacity and the corresponding element in active, or (1-opacity) and the corresponding element in base, respectively. Then, `vec_elemwise_add()` adds together the corresponding elements in the two resultant vectors to form the final output vector.",
    "Your given C++ function `normal_blend_f` calculates the blend of two vectors `base` and `active` based on the given `opacity`. The blend is computed as a weighted sum of the corresponding elements from `active` and `base` vectors, with weights being `opacity` and `1 - opacity`, respectively. \n\nIn Python, you can achieve the same functionality as the `normal_blend_f` function using the defined functions like `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_elemwise_add` like so:\n\n```python\n\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    term1 = vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n    return reduce_sum(term1)\n```\n\nIn this Python function, `vec_scalar_mul` is used to scale the `active` and `base` vectors by `opacity` and `1 - opacity`, respectively. Then, `vec_elemwise_mul` is used to perform element-wise multiplication between the scaled vectors. Finally, `reduce_sum` is used to sum up all the elements in the resultant vector.",
    "To rewrite the C++ function `normal_blend_f` into Python, you can use the provided functions `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_scalar_mul` for element wise and scalar multiplication respectively, `vec_elemwise_add` for element wise addition, and `vec_scalar_sub` to subtract a scalar from a vector. The rewritten function will look like this:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    active_mul = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    base_mul = vec_scalar_mul(vec_scalar_sub(1, [opacity]), base)\n    return vec_elemwise_add(active_mul, base_mul)\n```\nThis Python function does the same as the C++ function: it takes two vectors 'base' and 'active', and a scalar 'opacity'. It multiplies each element of the 'active' vector by 'opacity', and each element of the 'base' vector by '(1 - opacity)', and then it adds these two resultant vectors elementwise. The resultant vector 'out' will be returned.",
    "Given the provided defined functions, the C++ function `normal_blend_f` can be rewritten as follows in Python:\n\n```\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    out = vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n    return out\n```\n\nHere, the `vec_scalar_mul` function multiply each element of the vector `active` with `opacity` and each element of the vector `base` with `(1 - opacity)`. Then the `vec_elemwise_add` function adds up the element-wise multiplication results of both vectors to generate the final result.",
    "Here is how you can translate the given C++ function \"normal_blend_f\" in to python by using the provided function:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    mix1 = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    mix2 = vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base)\n    out = vec_elemwise_add(mix1, mix2)\n    return out\n```\nIn the given C++ function, the elements of two vectors are multiplied with two scalars \"opacity\" and \"1-opacity\" and then these vectors are added to create a new vector. \n\nIn python function, first, the opacity is multiplied with vector `active` using `vec_scalar_mul` which multiplies each element of `active` with opacity. \nSimilarly, `1-opacity` is multiplied with vector `base` using `vec_scalar_mul` function. \nThen `vec_elemwise_add` adds these two resultant vectors element wise to create a new vector which is then returned. \n\nThis python function will give output same as the original C++ function."
