    "You can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with a lambda function as the selection function to achieve the equivalent functionality to your C++ function. The lambda function will select the larger of the two input values, which is equivalent to the if-else logic in your C++ code.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python code:\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(x < y, y, x))\n```",
    "The given C++ function `lighten_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` of same dimensions and blends them together using the lighten blend mode. It compares each pixel in the base layer with the corresponding pixel in the active layer and picks the pixel that has the greater value.\n\nThis function can be rewritten as a single return statement in Python using the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function. \n\nHere is the Python equivalent of the `lighten_blend_8` function:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same as the given C++ function. It compares each pixel in the base layer with the corresponding pixel in the active layer and picks the pixel that has the greater value. The `max` function is used as the selection function for `matrix_selection_two_args` function.",
    "The `lighten_blend_8` function in C++ is performing a pixel-wise maximum operation between two images named `base` and `active`. It iterates over every pixel and chooses the maximum pixel value between the two images and assigns it to the output image. We can achieve the same functionality in Python using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function in Python takes two matrices and a function as arguments. It applies the function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. In this case, we use the `max` function to take the maximum of each pair of pixel values. The result is a new matrix (or image) where each pixel is the maximum of the corresponding pixels in the input images.",
    "The C++ function named `lighten_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors named `base` and `active`, and returns a new 2D vector where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. \n\nThe Python equivalent of this function can be rewritten using the function `matrix_selection_two_args` which allows us to apply a function to corresponding elements in two matrices. We use the `max` function as the argument to `matrix_selection_two_args`, which gives us the desired behaviour of selecting the maximum of the corresponding elements.\n\nHere's the Python equivalent:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis function behaves exactly the same as the given C++ function. It iterates over each element in the `base` and `active` lists, and for each pair, it returns the maximum. The result is a new list that contains the maximum value from either the `base` or `active` list for each position.",
    "The provided C++ function `lighten_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors, `base` and `active`, and compares each corresponding element in both vectors. If the element from `base` is lower than the one from `active`, it takes the value from `active`, otherwise it takes the value from `base`. This is done for all elements in both 2D vectors and the result is a new 2D vector.\n\nThe equivalent Python function using the provided functions would be:\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\nIn the python function, `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used which does exactly the same operation as the original C++ function. It takes two matrices and a function as arguments, applies the function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices, and returns a new matrix with the results. The `max` function is used as the function to apply to each pair of elements, which corresponds to taking the maximum of two values.",
    "The provided C++ function `lighten_blend_8` applies a \"lighten\" blending operation on two 2D arrays (representing images) pixel by pixel. It iterates over each pixel in the base and active images, and for each pixel, it selects the larger value between the base and active pixel.\n\nThis can be rewritten using the defined Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nHere we use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a given function (`max` in this case) on corresponding elements in two matrices.

The lambda function `lambda x, y: ite(x < y, y, x)` is equivalent to the if-else statement in the original function. It returns `y` if `x` is less than `y`, otherwise it returns `x`.
