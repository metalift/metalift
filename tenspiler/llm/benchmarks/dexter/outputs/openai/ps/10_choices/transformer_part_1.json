    "The `transformer_part1` function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part1(\n    token_position: int,\n    head: int,\n    head_size: int,\n    key_cache_layer: List[List[int]],\n    q: List[int]\n) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_div(\n            integer_sqrt(head_size * 1), \n            matrix_selection_two_args(\n                matrix_col_slice(\n                    key_cache_layer, \n                    0, \n                    token_position\n                ), \n                vec_slice(\n                    q, \n                    head * head_size, \n                    (head + 1) * head_size\n                ), \n                lambda x, y: x * y\n            )\n        ), \n        [1] * token_position\n    )\n```\nIn this function:\n\n- `matrix_col_slice` is used to select `timestep` rows from `key_cache_layer`.\n- `vec_slice` is used to select `head_size` elements starting from `head * head_size` from `q`.\n- `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to calculate the product of corresponding elements of sliced `key_cache_layer` and `q`.\n- `matrix_scalar_div` is used to divide each element of the product by `integer_sqrt(head_size * 1)`.\n- `matrix_vec_mul` is used to calculate the dot product of the resulting matrix and a vector of ones of length `token_position`, effectively summing each row of the matrix. This is the equivalent of the `attention.push_back(score)` operation in the original function.",
    "Based on the provided functions and the goal to avoid loops and only use a single return statement, the equivalent Python function `transformer_part1` could be written as follows:\n\n```Python\ndef transformer_part1(token_position, head, head_size, key_cache_layer, q):\n    return vec_map(\n        matrix_vec_mul(\n            matrix_col_slice(key_cache_layer, 0, token_position),\n            vec_scalar_div(\n                integer_sqrt(head_size), \n                vec_slice(q, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size)\n            )\n        ),\n        lambda x: x // integer_sqrt(head_size)\n    )\n```\n\nThis function achieves the same goal as the original C++ function. It calculates the attention scores for each timestep up to `token_position` by taking the dot product of the query vector `q` and the corresponding key vectors in `key_cache_layer`, then divides each score by the square root of `head_size`.\n\nThe `integer_sqrt` function is not defined in the provided Python functions, but we assume it to be equivalent to the C++ `integer_sqrt` function. If it should be included in the final function, you can define it as follows:\n\n```Python\ndef integer_sqrt(x): return int(x**0.5)\n```",
    "The `transformer_part1` function could be rewritten in Python using provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part1(token_position, head, head_size, key_cache_layer, q):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(\n        scalar_matrix_div(\n            integer_sqrt(head_size * 1),\n            matrix_col_slice(\n                matrix_row_slice(key_cache_layer, 0, token_position),\n                head * head_size,\n                (head + 1) * head_size\n            )\n        ),\n        vec_slice(q, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size)\n    )\n```\nIn the provided `transformer_part1` function, an attention score is calculated for each timestep up to `token_position`. This score is the dot product of a slice of the query vector `q` and a corresponding slice of the current timestep's key cache layer, divided by the square root of `head_size * 1` (which is simply `head_size`). This process is equivalent to multiplying the appropriately sliced and scaled key cache matrix by the sliced query vector, which is what the rewritten function does. Note that the `integer_sqrt` function is assumed to be available in the Python environment where the rewritten function is to be used.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the specified C++ function using only the provided functions. Please note that Python uses 0-based indexing, unlike C++ which uses 1-based indexing. Therefore, the indices in the rewritten function are adjusted accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part1(token_position, head, head_size, key_cache_layer, q):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(matrix_col_slice(key_cache_layer, 0, token_position), \n                          vec_scalar_div(integer_sqrt(head_size * 1), \n                                         vec_slice(q, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size)))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It slices the `key_cache_layer` matrix up to the `token_position`.\n2. It slices the `q` vector from `head * head_size` to `(head + 1) * head_size`.\n3. It divides each element of the sliced `q` vector by the square root of `head_size * 1` using `vec_scalar_div`.\n4. Finally, it multiplies the sliced `key_cache_layer` matrix with the modified `q` vector using `matrix_vec_mul`. This is equivalent to the inner loop in the original function where each element of the sliced `q` vector is multiplied with the corresponding element in each row of the sliced `key_cache_layer` matrix and the results are summed up.",
    "Here is the Python version of the function `transformer_part1` using the provided functions and constants. We use a combination of `matrix_vec_mul` for the multiplication part, `matrix_col_slice` for the slicing part, and `matrix_scalar_div` for the division part. Since we can't use loops, we handle the for loop using recursion in our helper functions.\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part1(token_position: int, head: int, head_size: int, key_cache_layer: List[List[int]], q: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_scalar_div(integer_sqrt(head_size), matrix_vec_mul(matrix_col_slice(key_cache_layer, 0, token_position), vec_slice(q, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size)))\n```\n\nThe function `transformer_part1` performs the following operations:\n\n- It slices the `key_cache_layer` matrix using `matrix_col_slice` from start to end where start is 0 and end is `token_position`. \n- It slices the list `q` using `vec_slice` from start to end where start is `head * head_size` and end is `(head + 1) * head_size`.\n- It multiplies the sliced matrix and sliced list element-wise using `matrix_vec_mul`.\n- It divides the result by the square root of `head_size` using `matrix_scalar_div`. The square root is calculated using the `integer_sqrt` function. \n\nPlease note that the `integer_sqrt` function is not defined in the provided functions so I assumed it's a global function that takes an integer and returns the square root of it.",
    "The transformation of the C++ function to Python function using the provided set of functions follows the same logic of the original function. It calculates the score for each timestep by multiplying corresponding elements from the query vector and key cache layer, summing these products, and dividing by the square root of the head size. The score for each timestep is added to the attention list.\n\nThe original C++ function uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to token_position and another inner for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to head_size. Since the Python functions prohibit the use of loops, we can use the `matrix_vec_mul` function to accomplish the multiplication and summation operations in the inner loop, the `vec_scalar_div` function to accomplish the division operation after the inner loop, and finally the `matrix_col_slice` function to accomplish the operation of the outer loop. \n\nIn detail, the `matrix_vec_mul` function takes as arguments the matrix formed by selecting the elements from the `key_cache_layer` corresponding to the current head, and a slice of the query vector corresponding to the current head, and returns a vector where each element is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the two input vectors. The `vec_scalar_div` function takes this vector and the square root of the head size as arguments and returns a vector where each element is the corresponding element from the input vector divided by the square root of the head size. The `matrix_col_slice` function takes this vector and the range from 0 to `token_position` as arguments and returns a slice of the vector from index 0 to `token_position - 1`. \n\nThe Python function equivalent of the provided C++ function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part1(token_position: int, head: int, head_size: int, key_cache_layer: List[List[int]], q: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_col_slice(vec_scalar_div(integer_sqrt(head_size), matrix_vec_mul(matrix_col_slice(key_cache_layer, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size), vec_slice(q, head * head_size, (head + 1) * head_size))), 0, token_position)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `integer_sqrt` function was not provided. Assuming it is a function that returns the square root of the input integer, I have used it in the `vec_scalar_div` function. If this function does not exist in your program, you should replace it with the correct function to compute the square root.",

The `integer_sqrt` function is not directly used because it just returns its input in the original code, and Python's division is equivalent to integer division when the divisor and dividend are integers.",

Then `vec_scalar_div` is used to divide each element of the sliced `q` vector by the square root of `head_size` (here `integer_sqrt(head_size)` is used for simplicity).
