    "In Python, the C++ function can be translated as follows using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(vec_slice_with_length(output, 0, max_pos))\n```\nHere, `vec_slice_with_length` function is used to slice `output` from index `0` to `max_pos`. Then, `reduce_sum` is used to calculate the sum of these elements and finally return it. The transformation is semantically equivalent to the C++ function `softmax_part3`.",

    "The given C++ function `softmax_part3` is generating the sum of all elements from the beginning of a vector up to a given position `max_pos`. This operation can be rewritten in Python using the provided `reduce_sum` function to sum elements in a slice of the `output` list:\n\nPython function:\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\nIn this function, `output[:max_pos]` creates a slice of the original list from the beginning up to the element at the given position `max_pos`. This slice is then passed to the `reduce_sum` function, which returns the sum of all elements in the slice.",
    "Based on your constraints, the function `softmax_part3` could be rewritten in Python using the `reduce_sum` function and the `vec_slice_with_length` function like this:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(vec_slice_with_length(output, 0, max_pos))\n```\nBy using the `vec_slice_with_length` function, we are able to get a slice of the `output` list starting from the index 0 and up to `max_pos` (exclusive). Then, the `reduce_sum` function is used to sum the elements of that slice, producing the same result as the original C++ function. The results are returned directly without intermediate variables.",

The `reduce_sum` function is used to sum the elements of the resulting sublist, which was the purpose of the loop in the C++ code.",

It returns the sum of elements from the start of the `output` list up to `max_pos`. To inline as requested, the `test` function is rewritten using only `reduce_sum()` and `vec_slice_with_length()` functions from the provided helper functions in Python. The `vec_slice_with_length()` function is used to get all elements from index 0 to `max_pos` from the `output` list.

    "Given the restrictions and based on the C++ function provided, it looks like we can simply use the `reduce_sum` function with slicing operation using `vec_slice`. Here's the equivalent Python function using the provided primitives:\n\n```\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(vec_slice(output, 0, max_pos))\n```\n\nThis Python function `softmax_part3` captures the intention of the given C++ function: it calculates the sum of the elements up to `max_pos` in the `output` list."
