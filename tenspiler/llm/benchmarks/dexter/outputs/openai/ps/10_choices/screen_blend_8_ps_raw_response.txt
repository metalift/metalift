The screen_blend_8 function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(
        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),
        matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
    )
```
Here is what's happening:

- `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` is equivalent to `base[row][col] + active[row][col]` in the original function.
- `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` is equivalent to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col])` in the original function.
- `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))` is equivalent to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` in the original function.
- `matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))` is equivalent to `base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` in the original function.
The provided C++ function `screen_blend_8` performs a pixel-wise operation on two 2D matrices (representing images) using the formula `base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255`. This operation is a common one in image processing and is used to blend two images together.

Given that we cannot use loops and need to rewrite the function using the provided Python functions, we can use the `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_elemwise_sub`, `matrix_elemwise_mul`, and `scalar_matrix_div` functions to perform the pixel-wise operations.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(
        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),
        scalar_matrix_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
    )
```

In this function, `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` performs element-wise addition of the base and active matrices. `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` performs element-wise multiplication of the base and active matrices. `scalar_matrix_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))` divides every element of the multiplication result by 255. Finally, `matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), scalar_matrix_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))` subtracts the result of the division from the result of the addition. This corresponds to the operation performed in the original C++ function.
Here is the Python equivalent of the `screen_blend_8` function using the provided functions:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(
        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),
        matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
    )
```
This function does the following for each element in the `base` and `active` matrices:
1. Adds the corresponding elements in `base` and `active` using `matrix_elemwise_add`.
2. Multiplies the corresponding elements in `base` and `active` using `matrix_elemwise_mul`, and then divide each result by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div`.
3. Subtracts the result of step 2 from that of step 1 using `matrix_elemwise_sub`.

By doing these operations for each corresponding element in the two matrices, we replicate the functionality of the original `screen_blend_8` function.
The equivalent Python function using the provided set of functions would be as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(
                matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),
                matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
            )
```
This function performs the same operations as the original C++ function. It first multiplies the `base` and `active` matrices element-wise, then divides each element by 255. This result is subtracted from the element-wise addition of the `base` and `active` matrices, achieving the same result as the original function.
The C++ function `screen_blend_8` can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_add(
        base,
        matrix_elemwise_sub(
            active,
            matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
        )
    )
```

This function performs element-wise addition of the `base` matrix and the result of element-wise subtraction of `active` matrix and the result of dividing each element of the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` matrices by 255. This is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function.
You can rewrite the `screen_blend_8` function using only the provided functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_add(
        base,
        matrix_elemwise_sub(
            active,
            matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
        )
    )
```
This function first multiplies the base and active matrices elementwise, then divides the result by 255. The resulting matrix is then subtracted from the active matrix. Finally, the base matrix is added elementwise to the result. This corresponds to the operation performed in the original C++ function.
The `screen_blend_8` function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(
        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),
        matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))
    )
```

This Python function does the same operations as the original C++ function. It adds each element of `base` and `active` matrices, multiplies the elements of the same matrices and divides the result by 255, and finally, subtracts the latter result from the former one. The provided functions handle the iterations over the rows and columns of the matrices internally, so there's no need for explicit for-loops.
In Python, we can rewrite the given C++ function `screen_blend_8` using the provided functions as follows:

```Python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_add(
        base,
        matrix_elemwise_sub(
            active,
            matrix_scalar_div(
                255,
                matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)
            )
        )
    )
```

In this function, we first perform element-wise multiplication between the base and active matrices using the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function. Then, we divide the result by 255 using the `matrix_scalar_div` function.

Afterwards, we subtract the result from the active matrix using the `matrix_elemwise_sub` function. Finally, we add the base matrix to the result using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function. The result is a matrix that is semantically equivalent to the one produced by the original C++ function.
The `screen_blend_8` function in C++ is applying a screen blend operation on each pixel of two images represented as 2D matrices. It can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))
```

This function first adds the `base` and `active` matrices element-wise using `matrix_elemwise_add()`. Then, it multiplies the `base` and `active` matrices element-wise and divides the result by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div()`. Finally, it subtracts the two results using `matrix_elemwise_sub()`. All of these operations are done element-wise, which means they are applied to each pixel of the images.
The `screen_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def screen_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))
```
This function takes two matrices `base` and `active` as input. It performs the operation defined in the C++ function `screen_blend_8` by using the provided functions in Python - `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_elemwise_sub`, `matrix_scalar_div` and `matrix_elemwise_mul`.

The function `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` adds the two input matrices element-wise. The function `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` multiplies the two matrices element-wise. `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))` divides each element of the result of the multiplication by 255. Finally, `matrix_elemwise_sub` subtracts the result of the division from the result of the addition, yielding the output matrix.
