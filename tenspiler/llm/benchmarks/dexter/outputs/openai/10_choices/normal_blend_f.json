    "The input function `normal_blend_f` is a C++ function that performs operations on vectors. The function performs a blend operation on two vectors based on an opacity value. Based on the provided functionality set, you could achieve the same functionality with the following Python function.\n\n`vec_elemwise_add`, `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions are used to convert the functionality. The Python function will achieve the same functionality that the C++ function does but use the functions provided.\n\nThe Python equivalent of your C++ test function can look like this:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThis Python function `normal_blend_f` applies a weight (`opacity`) to elements of the `active` vector, adds the products to the complementary weighted elements from the `base` vector, and returns the resulting vector.\n\nThis is semantically equivalent to your original C++ `normal_blend_f` function.",
    "Here is how you can rewrite the `normal_blend_f` function using the defined methods:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n``` \nThis function does the same as the `normal_blend_f` in C++. It scales `active` by `opacity` and `base` by `1-opacity` and then adds the two.",
    "Here is how you can rewrite the `normal_blend_f` function using your defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n  # operations (1 - opacity) * base & opacity * active\n  vec_base = vec_scalar_mul(1-opacity, base) \n  vec_active = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active) \n  \n  # addition of base and active vectors\n  return vec_elemwise_add(vec_base, vec_active)\n```\n\nThis is equivalent to the given C++ version of `normal_blend_f` function. The helper function `vec_scalar_mul` performs scalar multiplication on vectors and `vec_elemwise_add` function adds the two vectors element-wise. These helper functions are used to perform the calculation and generate the result as stated in the `normal_blend_f` function.",
    "Based on the provided functions, you can rewrite the provided `normal_blend_f` function in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThis Python function makes use of the `vec_scalar_mul` and `vec_elemwise_add` functions to respectively multiply each value in `active` and `base` vectors by the `opacity` and `1 - opacity`, and then add the results element-wise.\n\nNote: This is a Python version of your function, and it assumes the `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions handle vectors (`std::vector<int>` in C++) similarly as in your original C++ function. Please always test the functionality before using.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the provided functions would be:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    blend1 = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    blend2 = vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)\n    return vec_elemwise_add(blend1, blend2)\n```",
    "Based on the provided C++ 'normal_blend_f' function and the set of Python functions, I assume the equivalent Python function would need to generate the same output. \nHere is my proposed Python equivalent:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\nThis function should generate the same output as the original C++ function. It multiplies the 'active' vector and 'base' vector by 'opacity' and '1-opacity' respectively using 'vec_scalar_mul' function and then sums the results using 'vec_elemwise_add' function. This is equivalent to the given C++ code.",
    "Here is your function rewritten in python using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n     opac_active = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)    # This generates opacity * active\n     inv_opac_base = vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base)    # This generates (1 - opacity) * base\n     return vec_elemwise_add(opac_active, inv_opac_base)    # Adding both vectors element-wise\n```\nThis should correctly replicate the function `normal_blend_f` in python provided the inputs `base`, `active` are lists and `opacity` is a scalar value. The `vec_scalar_mul` function multiplies each of the elements in the list by the scalar `opacity` and `vec_elemwise_add` iterates over two lists adding corresponding elements together.",
    "Here is how you can rewrite the test function in Python using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    result1 = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    result2 = vec_scalar_mul(1-opacity, base)\n    return vec_elemwise_add(result1, result2)\n```\n\nThis rewritten version essentially does the same operation as the C++ `normal_blend_f` function. It takes the product of `opacity` and `active` vector, `(1 - opacity)` and `base` vector, and adds these two vectors together. This is accomplished using the `vec_scalar_mul` and `vec_elemwise_add` functions you provided.",
    "The provided `test` C++ function can be rewritten in Python using given set of functions as:\n\n```Python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n   f1 = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n   f2 = vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)\n   return vec_elemwise_add(f1, f2)\n```\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ version. The `vec_scalar_mul` function is used to multiply elements of `base` and `active` vectors by `opacity` and `1 - opacity` respectively. The `vec_elemwise_add` function is then called to add the corresponding elements of the resultant vectors `f1` and `f2`.",
    "To rewrite the test function using Python using the provided functions, you would do as follows:\n\nKeep in mind that the `test` function in C++ uses a loop to iterate over the `base` vector, mixing the corresponding values from `base` and `active` vectors using `opacity` as a weight factor. This is equivalent to applying an element-wise addition of the results of scaling `base` and `active` vectors individually with the weights `1 - opacity` and `opacity` respectively.\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(\n        vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active),\n        vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)\n    )\n```\nThis Python function does exactly the same as the `test` function provided in C++. It will blend two vectors `base` and `active` together, using `opacity` as the blending factor. The `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` are helper functions provided.\n"
