    "The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nThis function is using the `matrix_selection_two_args` defined function that takes two matrices and a function that operate on two arguments. Here, we pass the `min` function of Python as the third argument, which will return the minimum value between the base and active matrices, which is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function.",
    "Here is the python equivalent of the C++ function using the defined functions. The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, with a custom selection function that chooses the minimum of two inputs.\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```",
    "You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function provided. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a given function to each pair of corresponding elements from two matrices. \n\nIn this case, we want to apply the `min` function, which will select the smaller of the two elements. This corresponds to the logic in the `if-else` statement in the original `darken_blend_8` function.\n\nThe rewritten function would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis version of `darken_blend_8` is a single return statement that uses only the provided functions and constants, as required. It's also more concise and arguably more readable than the original version, especially for someone familiar with functional programming.",
    "In Python, you can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function. This function takes two matrices and a function to perform element-wise operation on these matrices. For the function to perform the operation, you can use Python's built-in `min` function which returns the minimum of two values.\n\nHere's how you can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function will return a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices, which is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "In Python, the equivalent function to the provided C++ `darken_blend_8` function can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis Python function uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the Python built-in `min` function to corresponding elements of the `base` and `active` matrices. This is equivalent to selecting the smaller of the corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices, which is what the C++ function does. The result is a new matrix of the same size where each element is the smaller of the corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices.",
    "The given `darken_blend_8` C++ function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis Python function works the same way as the original C++ function. It takes two matrices (2D lists) as input and returns a new matrix. For each corresponding pair of elements in the two input matrices, it selects the smaller one (because `min` function is passed as the selection criterion) and puts it in the corresponding position in the output matrix. This process is equivalent to the pixel-by-pixel \"darken blend\" operation performed by the original C++ function.",
    "You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function in a single return statement using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This function applies a binary selection function to each pair of corresponding elements in two matrices. \n\nIn this case, the binary selection function should be the `min` function, which selects the smaller of two values. This is equivalent to the condition in the provided `darken_blend_8` function, which selects the smaller of `base[row][col]` and `active[row][col]`.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function takes as input two matrices of integers `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix.

    "You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which takes two matrices and applies a function to each corresponding pair of elements. In Python, you would use the built-in `min` function to get the minimum value of each pair, which produces the same result as the `if`-`else` statement in the original function. Here is the rewritten function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function works by applying `min` to each pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix with the results. This is equivalent to choosing the smaller of the two values for each pair, which is what the original `darken_blend_8` function does.",

This achieves the same result as the original C++ function, which selects the minimum of each pair of corresponding pixels in the base and active images.",
    "The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes in two 2D matrices `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix where each element is the minimum value of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. This function can be rewritten in python using the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function and the built-in `min` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a specified binary function (in this case, `min`) to each pair of corresponding elements in two matrices. This is exactly what the original C++ function is doing, so this python function is semantically equivalent to the original C++. The `min` function is used to select the smaller of the two pixel values."
