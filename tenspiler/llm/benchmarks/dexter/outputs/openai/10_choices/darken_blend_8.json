    "The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function is equivalent to the given C++ function. It loops over every pixel in the base and active images, and sets the corresponding pixel in the output image to be the minimum of the base and active pixels. This is the same behaviour as the `darken_blend_8` function in C++. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function iterates over all pixels in the two input images and applies the `min` function to each pair of corresponding pixels.",
    "The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function takes two matrixes and a function as arguments. It applies the given function to the corresponding elements of the two matrixes. In this case, `min` function is used as the argument, which is equivalent to selecting the smaller pixel from `base` and `active` in the original C++ function.",
    "The given `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which takes two matrices and a binary function (in this case, `min`). It applies the binary function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices and returns a new matrix with the results. This is equivalent to the operation performed in the original C++ function, which selects the minimum of corresponding elements in two matrices.",
    "The provided `test` C++ function `darken_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- `matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)` applies the `min` function to corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices. This is equivalent to the `if`-`else` block in your C++ code. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function iterates over the rows and columns of the `base` and `active` matrices, just like the nested `for` loops in your C++ code, applying the `min` function to the corresponding elements in each matrix. The resulting matrix is returned by the function.",
    "The task is to rewrite the given `darken_blend_8` C++ function into another function using a set of provided functions. The function takes two 2D vectors as arguments and returns a 2D vector. The function iterates through each element of the matrices, and for each corresponding pair of elements, it selects the minimum element and adds it to the output.\n\nThe provided functions, which are written in Python, are mainly for operating with lists and matrices. The equivalent function can be written using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with the `min` function passed as the argument for `select_two_args_arg`. This will select the minimum element for each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices.\n\nHere is the rewritten function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function is equivalent to the `darken_blend_8` C++ function. It takes two matrices as input and for each corresponding pair of elements, it selects the minimum one. The resulting matrix is returned. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the input matrices are of the same size.",
    "You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a function to corresponding elements in two matrices, which is exactly what `darken_blend_8` does. The function to apply is the minimum function, because for each pixel, `darken_blend_8` selects the smaller of the base and active pixel values. Here is the rewritten function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```",
    "The `darken_blend_8` function takes two 2D vectors, `base` and `active`, and returns a new 2D vector where each pixel is the minimum between the corresponding pixels in `base` and `active`. This is equivalent to selecting the darker pixel in each position when these 2D vectors represent images.\n\nFrom the provided functions, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function can be used to achieve this. This function applies a given binary function to corresponding elements of two matrices. The binary function we need here is the min function, which returns the smaller of two arguments. Unfortunately, this function is not provided, but we can define it using the `ite` function: `lambda x, y: ite(x < y, x, y)`. \n\nThe equivalent function in Python using only the provided functions and constants would be:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(x < y, x, y))\n```\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function. It constructs a new 2D list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`.\n",
    "The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This function takes two matrices and a binary function as arguments, applies the function to corresponding elements in the two matrices, and returns a new matrix. You can use the `ite` function (which stands for \"if-then-else\") as the binary function, with `>` as the condition, and `active[row][col]` and `base[row][col]` as the `if_then` and `if_else` arguments, respectively.\n\nHere's the rewritten function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(x > y, y, x))\n```\n\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. It iterates over the corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices. If the element in `base` is greater than the element in `active`, it adds the element from `active` to the new matrix. Otherwise, it adds the element from `base`. This is the same behavior as the given C++ function.",

It uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the `min` function to corresponding elements in `base` and `active` matrices, thereby achieving the same effect as the C++ function.",
    "The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` performs an operation known as \"darken blend\" on two matrices of the same size. The darken blend operation selects the pixel with the lesser value from the corresponding positions in the two input matrices.\n\nThis function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(x > y, y, x))\n```\n\nThis Python function uses `matrix_selection_two_args` function to perform an operation on corresponding elements of two matrices. The operation is defined as a lambda function `lambda x, y: ite(x > y, y, x)`, which uses the provided `ite` function to select the lesser of two values `x` and `y`.
