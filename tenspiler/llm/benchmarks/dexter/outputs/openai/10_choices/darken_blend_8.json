    "The `darken_blend_8` function in the C++ snippet performs an operation similar to the minimum function (min) for each corresponding pixel in the base and active images. You can utilize the defined function `matrix_selection_two_args` and the Python built-in function `min` in this task. So, you rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8 (base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function performs the selection function on two corresponding elements in the given matrices. In this case, the selection function is `min` which selects the smaller element of the pair. Hence, the reconstructed function `darken_blend_8` is equivalent to the original function.",
    "#rewritten function\nHere is the rewritten Python equivalent function using the provided set of methods:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function `darken_blend_8` takes in two arguments: `base` and `active`. It uses the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` to select the minimum between each pair of corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices, producing an identical result to the given C++ code.",

    "#rewritten function\n```Python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nIn this case, we're scanning through each pixel of the image and selecting the smaller value between `base[row][col]` and `active[row][col]`. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function allows us to perform a binary operation (in this case `min`, which corresponds to \"selecting the smaller element\") across all elements of two matching-size matrices.",
