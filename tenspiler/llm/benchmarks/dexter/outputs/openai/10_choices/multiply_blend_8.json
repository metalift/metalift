    "The given `test` C++ function `multiply_blend_8` applies a multiplication blend mode to 2D image data represented as 2D matrices. In this process, the corresponding pixel values in the `base` and `active` matrices are multiplied together, and then the result is divided by 255, to achieve a blended pixel value.\n\nHere is how you can rewrite the `test` function in python using provided functions. We will use the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to multiply corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices and then use `matrix_scalar_div` to divide each product by 255:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    intermediate = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)  # Multiply elements\n    out = matrix_scalar_div(255, intermediate)  # divide product by 255\n    return out\n``` \nThis python function performs the same operation as the original `multiply_blend_8` C++ function, using the provided functions. Note that the pixel values in the resulting matrix are in integer type because of the integer floor division. If you want your results in float-point precision, you would have to modify the division function accordingly. \n\nThe `multiply_blend_8` function assumes that the sizes of the `base` and `active` matrices are the same. It should be checked before the function call.",
    "You can rewrite the given `multiply_blend_8` C++ function using the provided Python defined functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), matrix_scalar_mul(255, base))\n```\n\nIn the given C++ function, first, it multiplies each pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active` matrices (which can be achieved using `matrix_elemwise_mul`). Then, it divides the result by 255. Since the divisor is a scalar, we can use `matrix_scalar_div`). The divisor is formed by multiplying the `255` with `base` but as the base is discarded in the division process, we can directly use `255` as the divisor.\n\nThis code assumes that both `base` and `active` are of the same dimensions, otherwise it will return an empty list due to the conditions set in the `matrix_elemwise_mul` and `matrix_scalar_div` functions.",
    "The given `multiply_blend_8` function in C++ can be converted into Python using the given set of Python functions. The equivalent Python code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(\n               matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active),\n               matrix_scalar_div(255, base)\n           )\n```\nIn the above Python code, `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` computes the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` matrices which is equivalent to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col])` in the C++ code. \n\nThen, `matrix_scalar_div(255, base)` computes 255 divided by each element in the `base` matrix which is the equivalent of `255` in the C++ code. \n\nLastly, `matrix_elemwise_div(...)` computes the element-wise division of the results which is equivalent to dividing the multiplied vectors by 255 in the C++ code.",
    "Your task is to rewrite the C++ `multiply_blend_8` function in Python using the provided functions.\n\nBased on the C++ code, it's a matrix multiplication operation, where each pixel in \"base\" image is multiplied with corresponding pixel in the \"active\" image and then divided by 255.\n\nYou can use `matrix_elemwise_mul()` provided function to perform element-wise multiplication between matrices \"base\" and \"active\". And then, convert the values of matrix by dividing each value by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div()` function.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python code using the provided functions:\n\n```Python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: list, active: list) -> list:\n    # Perform element-wise multiplication between 'base' and 'active':\n    matrix_mul = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)\n\n    # Convert the value of 'matrix_mul' by dividing each value by 255: \n    result = matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_mul)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis Python function takes 2D lists 'base' and 'active', and returns a 2D list which is semantically equivalent to the C++ 'multiply_blend_8' function.

It iterates over each element of the two provided matrices `base` and `active`, multiplies corresponding elements together, and then divides each multiplied product by 255. The result is a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrices. \n\nHere is a breakdown of the Python function:\n\n- `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` performs element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active`. It multiplies each element of `base` with the corresponding element of `active`.\n\n- `matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), [[255]*len(base[0])]*len(base))` will divide the result of the above operation by 255. \n\nThis requires creation of a matrix `[[255]*len(base[0])]*len(base)` with the same size as `base` and `active`, where every element is 255. This operation corresponds to the division by 255 in the C++ code.\n\nI hope this Python code helps you understand how the required function can be rewritten using the provided set of functions and constants. If you need further clarifications or have other related questions, please let me know!",
    "The existing `multiply_blend_8` function performs an element-wise multiplication between 2 same-sized 2D vectors (or matrices), followed by a division by 255.

Then, it uses `matrix_elemwise_div` to divide each element of the resulting matrix by 255. The size of the divisor matrix is adjusted to match the size of the base and active matrices.",
    "Given, the base function is `multiply_blend_8` which performs an elementary row-wise multiplication of elements in `base` and `active` matrix, followed by a division by `255`.\n\nThe job is to rewrite this function using the set of provided functions in python.\n\n```\n# helper function that would be applied element-wise\ndef blend(a, b):\n    return (a * b) // 255\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define a function `blend` that takes two arguments: `a` and `b`, performs the operation `(a * b) // 255` and returns the result.\n\nThen, we define the function `multiply_blend_8` that takes two arguments: `base` and `active`. It uses the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` that applies the `blend` function to each pair of corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices.\n\n\nIt's worth noticing that you need to ensure `base` and `active` matrices have the same dimensions. The provided functions and the rewritten function do not perform input validation, and they assume that the input is valid. If the input may be invalid, please consider adding input validation codes.",
    "In Python, the given `multiply_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the provided set of functions as following:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n\n    def multiply_blend_8_pixel(pixel1, pixel2):\n        return (pixel1 * pixel2) // 255\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, multiply_blend_8_pixel)\n```\n\nHere, for each pair of corresponding pixels in the source images `base` and `active`, we apply per-pixel operation represented by the `multiply_blend_8_pixel` which multiplies values of corresponding pixels and divide the result by 255. \n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function is suitable for applying this per-pixel operation because it traverses two matrices simultaneously (just as two nested loops in the original C++ function do).",
    "The equivalent Python function using the predefined functions is the following:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(\n        matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active),\n        [[255]*len(base[0])]*len(base)\n    )\n```\nThis function uses the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to perform the element-wise multiplication between `base` and `active`. The result is then divided by 255 to get the corresponding pixel value. The `matrix_elemwise_div` function is used for this purpose, and it requires that the divisor (`[[255]*len(base[0])]*len(base)`) has the same shape as the dividend (the result of `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)`). The `[[255]*len(base[0])]*len(base)` expression creates a matrix with the same shape as `base` and `active`, where all values are 255, which is needed for the division operation.",
    "The given C++ function `multiply_blend_8` takes two matrices `base` and `active` and performs an element-wise multiplication and division operation between these two matrices. This operation can be understood as a \"multiply blend\" operation, which is common in image processing for performing blending between color channels.\n\nWe can re-write this as a Python function using the provided functions as below:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Element-wise multiplication between the base and active matrices\n    multiply_matrix = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)\n    # Dividing each element in the output matrix by 255 using scalar_vec_div function inside a map function\n    out = vec_map(multiply_matrix.flatten(), lambda x: scalar_vec_div(255, x)).reshape(len(base), len(base[0]))\n    return out\n```\n\nThe function `multiply_blend_8` performs the multiply blend operation by following these steps:\n- It first multiplies `base` and `active` element-wise using the function `matrix_elemwise_mul`.\n- The result of the multiplication is flattened to form a 1-D vector, then every element of this vector is divided by 255 using the `scalar_vec_div` function. This is done inside a map operation using `vec_map`.\n- Finally, the output is reshaped back to the size of `m x n` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of input matrices.\n\nPlease note that the `flatten` and `reshape` functions are used assuming these are available numpy-like functions. These are just used to manipulate the shape of the data structure, they are not performing any operations on data itself so we can consider it within the context. If these are not allowed, it would require a more complex restructuring of the output matrix using the available basic functions."
