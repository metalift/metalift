    "The C++ function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    def neg_exp(x): return integer_exp(0 - x)\n    def div_by_exp_plus_one(x): return vec_elemwise_div([x], [1 + neg_exp(x)])[0]\n    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], div_by_exp_plus_one)\n```\nThis python function uses a subset of the provided functions (`integer_exp`, `vec_elemwise_div`, `vec_map`) and Python's list slicing to achieve the semantic equivalence to the given `transformer_part3` C++ function.\n\nIt uses the `integer_exp` function to calculate the exponent as in original function and then uses `vec_elemwise_div` to divide each element by 1+`integer_exp`(0-element) (which is equivalent to element*(1/1+`integer_exp`(-element) in original function)). All of this is done for each element of the input list up to the index specified by `hidden_dim` via using the function `vec_map`.\n\nIn the `vec_map`, `div_by_exp_plus_one` function is used as `map_int_to_int` argument. `div_by_exp_plus_one` function returns an integer result for each input element performs the said division operation.\n\nNote: one major difference is in C++ we would access elements beyond the length of the input list which would likely result in a segmentation fault, while in Python it will simply squelch the extra elements without complaint.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the provided C++ function using the provided helper functions.\n\nWe have a few steps to follow.\n\n    1. We start with the vec_map function to transform the elements of the input vector.\n    2. We create a lambda function for the map_int_to_int argument, which performs the operations found in the for loop of the transformer_part3.\n    3. Take the integer_exp of the negative of the current element, add one, take the reciprocal and then multiple by element itself to get the transformed element.\n\nThis is how it would look:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    transformed_input = vec_map(input[0: hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))\n    return transformed_input\n```\n\nPlease note that the exact operations performed in this function depend on the definition of the integer_exp function, which in your Python code doesn't seem to match with the one in your C++ code i.e., the C++ version simply returns its argument, while the Python does some recursive computation. Be sure to replace the Python version with a correct version if necessary.\n\nAlso, the division in Python is floating-point by default, whereas in C++ it is integer division. Hence, you might need to adjust it according to your requirement, in this case, we have used integer division in Python also to match the C++ operation.",
    "The provided C++ function `transformer_part3` can be rewritten in Python using the set of provided functions as follows:\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    # Apply integer_exp to each element in the input using vec_map\n    input_exp = vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], integer_exp)\n    \n    # Create a vector of 1s of size hidden_dim\n    ones = [1] * hidden_dim\n    \n    # Calculate 1 + integer_exp for each element in the input using vec_elemwise_add\n    denom = vec_elemwise_add(ones, input_exp)\n    \n    # Calculate 1 / (1 + integer_exp) for each element in the input using vec_elemwise_div\n    div = vec_elemwise_div(ones, denom)\n    \n    # Multiply the calculated divisors with the corresponding elements in the input vector using vec_elemwise_mul\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(input[:hidden_dim], div)\n\n    return output\n```\nThis Python function will behave similarly to the provided C++ function:\n\n1. It cuts-off the input vector down to the length of `hidden_dim` similarly to the for-loop in the C++ code.\n2. It calculates the `integer_exp` of each element.\n3. It calculates the value of `1 / (1 + exp(x))` for each element `x` in the input vector. The C++ and Python versions use integer division which behaves similarly in both languages.\n4. It multiplies each element in the input vector with the calculated values to generate the output vector.",
    "The C++ `test` function `transformer_part3` has its parameter `input` as a vector and an integer parameter `hidden_dim`. The function goes through the vector `input` till `hidden_dim`, computes `input[i] * (1/(1+integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` and saves the results to vector `output` it returns.\n\nTo implement this equivalent function in python, we utilize `vec_elemwise_mul`, `vec_map`, and `integer_exp` definitions provided inline. Here we go:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    def operation(x):\n        return x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))\n      \n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(input[:hidden_dim], vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], operation))\n    return output\n```\nIn the python function `transformer_part3`, `operation` is the function that calculates `x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))`, we then use `vec_map` to apply it to the input vector. After that, we multiply the input vector with the operation result by using `vec_elemwise_mul`. Note: slice operation `input[:hidden_dim]` in python is equivalent to a for loop in C++ till `hidden_dim`.",
    "Here's the Python equivalent code using the pre-defined functions. The `integer_exp` in the test function merely returns the same value, so I've implemented that without raising any value to a power (as the pre-defined `integer_exp` does). \n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    output = [input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))) for i in range(hidden_dim)]\n    return output\n\ndef integer_exp(x): \n    return x\n```\n\nThis newly defined `integer_exp` shadows the previously defined exponential function, instead implementing identity function as illustrated in the original `integer_exp` in the C++ function. This code constructs `output` vector by performing the operations directly applied on each of its elements and should have same functionality as the provided C++ test function.",
    "From the given context, it seems like you want the C++ transformer_part3 function to be rewritten in Python. Here's a Python equivalent of your function using the provided functions and constants:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(hidden_dim):\n        curr = vec_elemwise_mul([input[i]], [1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))])\n        output.append(reduce_sum(curr))\n    return output\n```\n\nThe above Python function tries to mimic the behaviour of the C++ function using the provided built-in functions. It performs elementwise multiplication for each element in the input up to hidden_dim with 1 divided by 1 plus the exponential of that element. Finally, it appends the result (which is a list containing one element) after taking the sum of the list to the output list. Consequently, the output is the list of these results for each element in the input up to hidden_dim.",
    "The given C++ function `transformer_part3` is calculating the elementwise logistic sigmoid transformation `(x / (1 + exp(-x)))` over a slice of the `input` vector up to `hidden_dim` elements. Notice that `integer_exp` is defined as an identity function in the C++ code but in provided Python functions, it is the implementation of integer exponentiation. I will use the Python `integer_exp` function for now.\n\nIn the given Python function set, there are no direct equivalents of the commands used in the `transformer_part3` C++ function. However, you can use a combination of elementwise operations, map functions and slice functions to reproduce the effect of the given `transformer_part3` function.\n\nPlease note that here is no provision in the provided Python functions to do division as done in the C++ implementation. The closest equivalent can be found in the provided `scalar_vec_div(a, x)` function. But this function performs integer division (`a // x[i]` type of operation) which isn't equivalent to the real division (`x[i] / a` type of operation).\n\nBased on the existing Python functions, here is the Python equivalent of `transformer_part3` without the division operation:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    negative_input = vec_scalar_mul(-1, input[:hidden_dim])\n    exp_negative_input = vec_map(negative_input, integer_exp)\n    one_plus_exp_negative_input = vec_scalar_add(1, exp_negative_input)\n    curr = vec_elemwise_mul(input[:hidden_dim], one_plus_exp_negative_input)  # No proper division available.\n    return curr\n```\n\nPlease note that without proper division operation, this function is not truly equivalent to the `transformer_part3` C++ function. ",
    "The C++ function `transformer_part3` can be translated into python using the provided set of functions. It appears that this function is implementing a sigmoid function inside a for loop. I will interpret integer division (1 / number) as integer flooring division operation (1 // number) in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(hidden_dim):\n        curr = vec_elemwise_mul([input[i]], [1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))])[0]\n        output.append(curr)\n    return output\n```\n\nIn the above function `vec_elemwise_mul` is used to accomplish `input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))`. \n\nOverall, this standards for a simplified approach of a Sigmoid function which in its complete form should include a division between 1 and the sum of 1 and the exponential, something like `1 / (1 + integer_exp(-input[i]))`. As `/` operator in python performs float division, and it seems you want all operations to be in integers, `//` was used instead. Please note that this might not give accurate results if actual Sigmoid behavior is desired.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of your C++ \"test\" function using the pre-defined functions:\n\n```Python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    output = []\n    # As Python uses dynamic typing, we don't need to check if i is in the range of hidden_dim,\n    # As a result, we directly loop over the input list.\n    for x in input:\n        curr = vec_elemwise_mul([x], vec_scalar_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map([x * -1], integer_exp))))\n        output = vec_elemwise_add(output, curr) # concatenate the current output with the list \"output\"\n    return output\n```\nPlease note that the \"integer_exp\" function in the C++ code seems to return the input unchanged, this may not be the same as e^x function usually used in this context (sigmoid operation). I followed your C++ function strictly in terms of behavior.\n\nAlso note that we assume the input is a list of integers, and \"hidden_dim\" is basically the length of the list.\n",
    "The given C++ function `transformer_part3` is performing element-wise computation of a mathematical formula over a vector. This function iterates over each element in the input vector, applies the formula `input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` to it, and collects the results into the output vector.\n\nTo rewrite this function using the given Python functions, we would use the `vec_map` function. This function applies a given mapping function on each element of the input vector and produces an equivalent output vector. \n\nOur 'mapping' function would be the mathematical formula being applied in the original C++ function i.e. `element * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - element)))`. Since the `integer_exp` function and the basic arithmetic operations are already provided, we can directly use them in the mapping function. \n\nI'd like to note that, as per the given `integer_exp` function, it does not return the traditional exponential (like the `exp` function in standard libraries of Python, C++ etc.). Instead, it is computing a different operation where `3` is multiplied with `integer_exp(x - 1)` (with recursion) and then `mod 64` is applied. \n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input, hidden_dim):\n    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))\n```\n\nGiven that `integer_exp` uses a modified definition of exponentiation, keep in mind that if you need the mathematical exponential function, you'll need to redefine `integer_exp` accordingly.\n"
