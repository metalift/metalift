    "Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function `color_dodge_8` using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(y == 255, 255, x // (255 - y)))\n```\n\nThis function returns a matrix where each pixel value is computed based on the corresponding pixel values in the `base` and `active` matrices. If the pixel value in the `active` matrix is 255, the output pixel value is 255. Otherwise, the output pixel value is the pixel value from the `base` matrix divided by `(255 - the pixel value from the active matrix)`. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply this computation to each pair of corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` matrices. The `ite` function is used to implement the if-else conditional logic.",
    "The `color_dodge_8` function loops through each pixel in two 2D arrays (or images), `base` and `active`. If the pixel value in the `active` image is 255, it sets the corresponding pixel in the output image to 255. Otherwise, it divides the pixel value in the `base` image by 255 minus the pixel value in the `active` image. \n\nThis function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to iterate over each pair of corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` images, and the `ite` function to choose between the two possible output pixel values. \n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(y == 255, 255, x // (255 - y)))\n```\n\nThis function uses a lambda function to perform the operation on each pair of corresponding pixel values from the `base` and `active` images.\n\nNote: The division operation in the C++ function is integer division, which is equivalent to the // operator in Python.",

For each pair of corresponding pixels, it selects a value based on the condition inside the `ite` function. If the pixel in the `active` image is 255, it selects 255. Otherwise, it selects the pixel in the `base` image divided by `(255 - pixel in the active image)`. This is equivalent to the original C++ function.",

For each pair of corresponding elements, it checks if the active matrix element is 255. If it is, the pixel value is set as 255. Otherwise, it sets the pixel value as the base matrix element divided by `(255 - active matrix element)`. This is done using the `ite` function inside a lambda function.

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to generate the output matrix. Inside `matrix_selection_two_args`, we use the `ite` function to decide each pixel value.

The applied function is a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns `255` if `y` is `255`, else it returns `x // (255 - y)`.
