    "The equivalent code in Python using the provided functions would be:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Define a helper function to perform the pixel calculation\n    def pixel_calculation(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return base_pixel + active_pixel - (base_pixel * active_pixel) // 255\n\n    # Use the matrix_selection_two_args function to apply the pixel_calculation function to both matrices.\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_calculation)\n\n```",
    "Here is how you can rewrite a given `screen_blend_8` C++ function with Python using provided functions. \n\nThe C++ function `screen_blend_8` takes as input two 2D vectors, `base` and `active`, and applies a specific operation to each pair of corresponding elements. For each pair (base[row][col], active[row][col]), the resulting element is base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255.\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    def operation(x, y):\n        return x + y - (x * y) // 255\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, operation)\n```\n\nDuring the operation execution, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function will select and pass a pair of corresponding elements to the `operation` function, effectively implementing the same logic as the C++ code. This is done separately for each row (recursively performed by the `matrix_selection_two_args` function) and within each row (recursively performed by the `selection_two_args` function). So the final result will be a new matrix with the same size as the input matrices but filled according to the `operation` function rules.",
    "This is the Python version equivalent to the `screen_blend_8` function in C++:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args_arg(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    return base_pixel + active_pixel - (base_pixel * active_pixel) // 255\n\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nHere, `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a given operation (`select_two_args`) on corresponding elements of two matrices (`base` and `active`). You could provide the operation function, which in this case is addition, subtraction, and division operation wrapped in `select_two_args_arg`. This should give the same result as `screen_blend_8` in C++. Please ensure that you have the given functions defined correctly to use this code.",
    "Based on the `screen_blend_8` function written in C++, we can rewrite it using the defined functions above in Python. Here is an equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Create three matrix corresponding to each section of the formula.\n    # Firstly, base[row][col] + active[row][col]\n    first = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n\n    # Secondly, (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255\n    second = matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), 255)\n\n    # Then subtract second matrix from first matrix.\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(first, second)\n```\n\nThe function `screen_blend_8` takes two matrices `base` and `active`. It first adds up these two matrices. Then it multiplies these matrices and divides the result by 255. Finally, it subtracts these two results using a matrix element-wise subtraction operation.\n\nThe function `matrix_elemwise_add` adds two matrices element-wise. `matrix_elemwise_mul` multiplies two matrices element-wise, and `matrix_elemwise_div` divides two matrices element-wise. `matrix_elemwise_sub` subtracts one matrix from another one.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python code utilizing provided functions. Note that I assume that the '/' operator in original function is integer division(\"//\" in Python) to maintain integer values in the matrix:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    temp1 = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n    temp2 = vec_scalar_mul(1/255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(temp1, temp2)\n```",
    "Here's how you can rewrite the C++ function `screen_blend_8` using only the provided Python functions. We will use the `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_elemwise_mul` and `matrix_scalar_div` functions for this purpose:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Calculate base[row][col] * active[row][col] / 255 for each pixel\n    product_matrix = matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n    \n    # Calculate base[row][col] + active[row][col] for each pixel\n    sum_matrix = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n    \n    # Subtract the two matrices to get the final result\n    out = matrix_elemwise_sub(sum_matrix, product_matrix)\n    \n    return out\n```\nThis Python function achieves the same thing as the C++ function. It first calculates the element-wise product of the base and active matrices divided by 255. It then adds the base and active matrices element-wise. Finally, it subtracts the previously calculated product matrix from the sum matrix to give the output. The result is a new matrix where each element corresponds to the same calculation done in the original C++ code for each pixel.",
    "Your outlined C++ function `screen_blend_8` can be represented by using the given Python functions as below:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    def pixel_blend(x, y):\n        return x + y - (x * y) // 255\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_blend)\n```\nThe function `screen_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active`. It applies a pixel blending function to corresponding elements of `base` and `active`. The pixel blending operation is defined as `x + y - (x * y) // 255`. Finally, it uses the function `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply this pixel blending operation to every corresponding pair of elements in the two input matrices, thus mimicking the behavior of the nested loop in your C++ program.",
    "The C++ function `screen_blend_8` accepts two matrices of integers as input, `base` and `active`, and applies a certain calculation to every pair of corresponding elements in both matrices to generate and return a new output matrix.\n\nHere is the Python function that achieves the same operation defined using the provided set of functions and constants. Note the mainly used function is `matrix_selection_two_args` which takes two matrices and applies a certain calculation represented by `select_two_args_arg` to each pair of corresponding elements in both matrices:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    # define the calculating function that will be applied to corresponding elements in both matrices\n    select_two_args_arg = lambda x, y: x + y - (x * y) // 255\n    # generate the output matrix\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n    \n    return out\n```\nNote that integer division (//) is used instead of float division (/) to match the nature of the C++ division in the original function. The lambda function matches the main calculation in the C++ algorithm.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the provided C++ function using the given functions:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n\n    def blend(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return base_pixel + active_pixel - (base_pixel * active_pixel) // 255\n\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend)\n    return out\n```\nThis Python function should provide the same results as your C++ function. It uses `matrix_selection_two_args` function which applies the `blend` function to each elements of `base` and `active` matrices. The `blend` function is the Python equivalent of the pixel calculation in your C++ function.",
    "Redefining the given `test` with the help of above mentioned python functions:\n```\ndef select_two_args_arg(x, y):\n    pixel = x + y - ((x * y) // 255)\n    return pixel\n  \ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\nIn our approach, we are utilizing the function `matrix_selection_two_args()` which applies a specific operation on two matrices element by element. The operation is specified in the function `select_two_args_arg()`, which is the equivalent of the pixel calculation in the original `test` function."
