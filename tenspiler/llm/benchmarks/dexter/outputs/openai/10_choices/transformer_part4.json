    "The 'transformer_part4' function multiplies each pair of corresponding values in 'input1' and 'input2' using a for loop up to 'hidden_dim' iterations. This operation can be represented in Python using the provided 'vec_elemwise_mul' function, which does an element-wise multiplication of two vectors. You don't need to worry about the 'hidden_dim' parameter in this case because these vector operations are performed element-wise, i.e., feature by feature - if vectors have different lengths, the function will stop at the smallest length.\n\nHere is the Python version of the function using the defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2):\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)\n```",
    "Based on the provided functions, the equivalent Python function `transformer_part4_rewritten` of the given C++ function `transformer_part4` is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4_rewritten(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])\n```\n\nThe implemented Python function `vec_elemwise_mul` performs element-wise multiplication between two given vectors, exactly as the loop in the provided C++ function does. Moreover, `input1[:hidden_dim]` and `input2[:hidden_dim]` slice the input vectors up to the index `hidden_dim - 1`, inclusive, which corresponds to the loop counter `i` reaching `hidden_dim` in the C++ function. Thus, the Element copy of hidden_dim elements of both input1 and input2 vectors are used in the multiplication which is performed by `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The final result is the multiplication of equivalent elements in those vectors.",
    "You can use the function `vec_elemwise_mul` to replicate your 'test' function as it takes two vectors as inputs and multiplies corresponding elements together. However, if the `hidden_dim` is not equal to the length of both vectors, you need to slice the vectors first.\n\nFor slicing, you need two other functions: 'firsts' and 'rests'. These can be used recursively to get the first `hidden_dim` elements of your vectors. After that, you can directly apply `vec_elemwise_mul`:\n\nThe code becomes:\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    sliced_input1 = input1[:hidden_dim]\n    sliced_input2 = input2[:hidden_dim]\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(sliced_input1, sliced_input2)\n    return output\n```\n\nNote: This code assumes that Python's list slicing facilities are available. If not, you would need to create a custom function to replicate their behaviour.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the test function:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])\n```\n\nThis is doing exactly the same operations as the 'test' function. It first reduces the `input1` and `input2` vectors to their first `hidden_dim` elements. Afterwards, it applies an element-wise multiplication operation. The `vec_elemwise_mul` Python function will return a new array (Python equivalent of a C++ vector), where each element is the result of multiplying corresponding elements from the shortened `input1` and `input2` vectors. Like in C++, this operation is done element by element and in order.",
    "The given `transformer_part4` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])\n```\n\nThe function `vec_elemwise_mul` performs element-wise multiplication of two vectors which is equivalent to `input1[i] * input2[i]` in the original `transformer_part4` function. The indexing `[:hidden_dim]` limits the computation up to the `hidden_dim` elements of `input1` and `input2` which is equivalent to `for (int i = 0; i < hidden_dim; i++)` in the original `transformer_part4` function.",
    "You can rewrite the given `transformer_part4` C++ function in Python using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function provided:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    # take a slice of input1 and input2 upto hidden_dim\n    input1 = input1[:hidden_dim]\n    input2 = input2[:hidden_dim]\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)\n    return output\n```\n\nThis Python function will have the same functionality as your C++ function, but note that unlike in C++, Python will not modify the original input lists if `hidden_dim` is less than the length of the input lists. \n\nThe `vec_elemwise_mul` function simply multiplies corresponding elements from two lists together, which is exactly what your original C++ function is doing. Before using `vec_elemwise_mul`, we slice `input1` and `input2` based on `hidden_dim`. This is equivalent to your C++ for loop only running until `i < hidden_dim`.",
    "The C++ test function 'transformer_part4' is performing element-wise multiplication of two vectors. This can be achieved using the vec_elemwise_mul function from those that are provided. Here's the translated function:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])\n```\nThis Python function cuts the input1 and input2 lists until the hidden_dim index and then multiplies the vectors element-wise using the provided vec_elemwise_mul function. The hidden_dim parameter is used to determine the relevant dimension of the vectors.",
    "The given `transformer_part4` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    if len(input1) >= hidden_dim and len(input2) >= hidden_dim:\n        input1 = input1[:hidden_dim]\n        input2 = input2[:hidden_dim]\n        return vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)\n    else:\n        raise Exception(\"The hidden_dim exceeds the length of provided vectors.\")\n```\n\nIn this Python function, we first check if the dimensions of `input1` and `input2` are larger or equal to `hidden_dim`. If the condition is satisfied, we use the `vec_elemwise_mul` function which multiplies the elements of `input1` and `input2` and returns the result vector. It is similar to what the C++ `transformer_part4` function does. On the contrary, if the condition isn't met, we throw an exception, as the original C++ function would have thrown a segmentation fault error for accessing an index beyond the array bounds.",
    "Here is the equivalent function `transformer_part4` written in Python using the provided helper functions:\n\n```Python\n#test function\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    # We use the function vec_elemwise_mul to perform element-wise multiplication of input1 and input2\n    # But as the original C function only multiplies up to hidden_dim elements,\n    # We will slice input1 and input2 up-to hidden_dim elements using python's slicing\n    # The result of the vec_elemwise_mul is our output\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])\n```\nThe `vec_elemwise_mul` helper function was used instead of a loop to perform elementwise multiplication of `input1` and `input2`, only considering the elements up to `hidden_dim`, and the result is directly returned as the `output`. By doing this, the `transformer_part4` function becomes simpler and easier to read.",
    "You can use the `vec_elemwise_mul` function in the provided set of functions to rewrite the `test` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1, input2, hidden_dim):\n    input1_sliced = input1[:hidden_dim]\n    input2_sliced = input2[:hidden_dim]\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1_sliced, input2_sliced)\n```\n\nIn this python function, `input1_sliced` stores the first `hidden_dim` elements of vector `input1`, and `input2_sliced` stores the first `hidden_dim` elements of vector `input2`. The `vec_elemwise_mul` function then returns a new vector such that each element in the new vector is the product of the corresponding elements in the `input1_sliced` and `input2_sliced` vectors. This function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ `transformer_part4` function."
