    "The given C++ function 'softmax_part4' can be rewritten in Python using the set of provided functions as shown below:\n\n```python\n# Python function\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    result = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], vec_scalar_mul(sum, vec_scalar_add(0, vec_map(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], lambda x: 1))))\n    return result\n```\nExplanations:\n- The first argument of 'vec_elemwise_div' is a slice of 'unnormalized_output' from index 0 to 'max_pos' (exclusive) \n- The second argument of 'vec_elemwise_div' is a vector obtained by multiplying 'sum' with a vector of ones. This vector of ones has the same size as the slice of 'unnormalized_output' from index 0 to 'max_pos' (exclusive). It is created by 'vec_map'.\n- The use of 'vec_scalar_add' is just to make sure we have a list as the operand for the scaling operation and won't affect the result. \n\nThis rewritten function gives the same result as the initial C++ code. \n\nHowever, please note that this Python method uses Python's array slicing which I'm not sure can be considered a primitive operation and it may not fit into the constraints mentioned in the task. I used this to select a subset of 'unnormalized_output', to not exceed 'max_pos' in the computation. There do not seem to be provided functions in your list which allow accessing or limiting the range of elements.",
    "Here is the equivalent function in Python using the defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    if max_pos < 1:\n        return []\n    else:\n        output = vec_scalar_div(sum, unnormalized_output[:max_pos])\n        return output\n```\nHere, the function softmax_part4 divides each element of the list `unnormalized_output`, till the `max_pos` index, by the `sum` parameter. This is achieved using the `vec_scalar_div` function.",
    "You can use the `vec_scalar_div` function to reproduce the `softmax_part4` function. The function `vec_scalar_div` performs a division operation between a vector and a scalar, which is the same operation performed in `softmax_part4`.\n\nHere's how you can write this:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_scalar_div(sum, unnormalized_output[:max_pos])\n    return output\n```\n\nIn this function, `unnormalized_output[:max_pos]` selects the first `max_pos` items from the vector `unnormalized_output`, and `vec_scalar_div(sum, unnormalized_output[:max_pos])` performs division operation between these selected items and the scalar `sum`, which reproduces exactly the behavior of the original `softmax_part4` function.",
    "This is an equivalent rewrite of the `softmax_part4` function in Python using your defined function:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*len(unnormalized_output[:max_pos]))\n    return output\n```",
    "Based on the function definition, you could transform the C++ code into Python using the provided primitive operations like this:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n```\n\nGiven, `vec_elemwise_div` is a builtin function to element wise divide two vectors, and list multiplication is used to make list with `max_pos` count of the sum. List slicing is used to select the first `max_pos` elements from `unnormalized_output`.\n\nThis python code has the same functionality as the provided C++ code. It picks the elements up to `max_pos` from `unnormalized_output` and divides each by `sum` using the built-in `vec_elemwise_div`.",
    "The required Python function, using only the provided function-set to replicate the functionality of the quoted c++ function, can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], vec_scalar_mul(sum, [1]*max_pos))\n```",
    "The C++ function `softmax_part4` takes a vector of integers, a maximum position, and sums this up to the maximum position. This function is then normalizing the unnormalized_output by the sum. The Python function that would be equivalent of this would utilize the `vec_elemwise_div` function for the listed operations. The code is provided below.\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return output\n```\nThe `softmax_part4` python function takes the slice of `unnormalized_output` up to `max_pos` and then divides each element of that slice by the `sum` using the `vec_elemwise_div` function. It constructs a list of `sum` repeated `max_pos` times to match the sizes required for `vec_elemwise_div`. It does not modify `unnormalized_output` and does not have any side effects, so it is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python function using the provided Python functions. In this Python code, a lambda function is used inside the `vec_map` function to divide each element of `unnormalized_output` by the `summ`.\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, summ):\n    return vec_map(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], lambda x: x // summ)\n```\n\nNote: This code assumes that `max_pos` is never greater than the length of `unnormalized_output`. Also, the integer division operator `//` is used to match the original C++ code's behavior.",
    "Here is the rewritten function in Python using only the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, _sum):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*len(unnormalized_output[:max_pos]))\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- All `int` inputs are transformed into list.\n- Provided functions are used with slight modification in signatures to adhere to Python standards. Python does feature to directly replace `for` loops that modify a list element by element. It supports list slicing, with is functionally similar to your sample C++ function. Hence the final function is not an exact match to the loops in C++, but it does describe the exact same functionality.  \n\nNote: This Python function does take advantage of some Python idioms, like list slicing and list multiplication. The function `vec_elemwise_div` replaces the loop you have, performing elementwise division on an array (or in Python terms, a list). The `unnormalized_output[:max_pos]` returns a sliced list upto max_pos, like the for loop in the provided C++ test function. And, `[sum]*len(unnormalized_output[:max_pos])` generates a list of length same as the sliced list, where each element contains the sum to perform the division with. But as the sum is not iterable, it has been provided as list of repeated sum, hence the multiplication. All these features of Python have been used to create a function that mirrors the functionality of the C++ function.",
    "Here is your Python equivalent version of given C++ code using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return output\n```\nThis rewritten function should be functionally equivalent to your provided C++ function.\n\nIn this function, the division of each element in the list `unnormalized_output` in the range from 0 to `max_pos` is performed by `sum`. The `vec_elemwise_div` function, provided earlier, performs these calculations. It returns a new list with the results of the division."
