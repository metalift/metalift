    "The equivalent Python function using the pre-defined functions is:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, _sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return output\n```\n\nIn the given C++ function, it divides all values before the `max_pos` by `sum` on `unnormalized_output`. We can achieve this in Python by using list slicing to get the desired portion of the list (`unnormalized_output[:max_pos]`) and then using `vec_elemwise_div()` function to divide all these values by `sum`. We create a list of size `max_pos` with all values as `sum` (`[sum]*max_pos`) for the division.",
    "Based on the provided functions, here is Python code equivalent to your C++ `softmax_part4` function:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[0:max_pos], vec_scalar_mul(sum, [1]*max_pos))\n    return output\n```\nThe `vec_elemwise_div` function is used to divide each element of the `unnormalized_output` list by `sum`. The portion of the `unnormalized_output` list is determined by slicing with `[0:max_pos]`.\nThe second argument for `vec_elemwise_div` is created by scaling a list of ones with length `max_pos` by `sum` using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. This creates a list of the same size as the sliced `unnormalized_output` that only contains the value `sum`. This is necessary because the `vec_elemwise_div` function accepts two lists of the same size, and divides element-wise.",
    "The function `softmax_part4` written in C++ can be rewritten in Python as follows using the provided helper functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum_):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[0:max_pos], [sum_]*max_pos) \n```\nIn the softmax_part4 function, the division operation with the vector `unnormalized_output` (from 0 to max_pos) and `sum_`, is performed element-wise. The `vec_elemwise_div` function performs element-wise division between two vectors. \n\nTo use this function `vec_elemwise_div` for scalar `sum_` and vector `unnormalized_output`, I have created another vector of same size but with all elements as `sum_` to make the division operation compatible with the framework rules.\n\nThe sub-list `unnormalized_output[0:max_pos]` in Python is equivalent to the C++ version `unnormalized_output[i]` where `i`= (0, max_pos). In Python, we have the ability to slice a list in one line, hence it doesn't require a loop for getting part of the vector like in C++. \n\nTherefore, the Python version of the function `softmax_part4` is more concise than the C++ version.\n\nPlease note that if elements of `unnormalized_output` and `sum_` are floating point numbers then float division should be used in place of integer division. \n\nAlso, the current code will work correctly provided that sum_ != 0. Add an additional check to avoid ZeroDivisionError:\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum_):\n    if sum_ == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Sum value cannot be zero\")\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[0:max_pos], [sum_]*max_pos)\n```",
    "Your rewritten function would look like this in Python:\n\n```Python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return output\n```\nIn this function `[:]` is used to slice the `unnormalized_output` vector till `max_pos` and the `vec_elemwise_div` function is used to divide each element of the `unnormalized_output` vector by sum. Also `[sum]*max_pos` is used to create a list of length `max_pos` where every element is the `sum` variable. This is equivalent to dividing each element of `unnormalized_output` till `max_pos` by `sum` as in the C++ code.",
    "Below is a rewritten Python function using the provided operations that seeks to replicate the same function performed by the C++ code. The original C++ code performs a partial computation of a softmax activation function in machine learning. The softmax activation function is a operation used in various machine learning algorithms, where an array of numbers are obtained through any type of scoring system, and it provides a probability distribution as output, this means that the output is a list of probabilities of events that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. In this case softmax_part4 function normalizes an array from position 0 to max_pos, divided by a sum.\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], vec_scalar_mul(sum, [1]*max_pos))\n```\n\nThis Python function slices the vector 'unnormalized_output' from index 0 to 'max_pos' exclusive, and performs element-wise division with another vector created by multiplying 'sum' with a vector of ones with length 'max_pos'. This corresponds to the action of softmax_part4 function in the given C++ function where each element from index 0 to 'max_pos' exclusive in the vector 'unnormalized_output' is divided by 'sum'.",
    "The provided `test` C++ function in Python can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return output\n\n```\n\nHere,\n\n- The `vec_elemwise_div` function is used which performs element-wise division between two same-sized vectors. We pass our `unnormalized_output` vector with first `max_pos` elements to it along with a vector of size `max_pos` having all elements as `sum`. This reflects the division operation performed in the loop in the original C++ function.\n- The result is directly returned as the `output`.\n\nThis Python code using provided functional programming style functions performs the equivalent operation to the provided C++ code.",
    "The given C++ code is a function (`softmax_part4`) which computes a part of the softmax function. With the help of provided functions, we can rewrite it as shown below. Note that instead of modifying `unnormalized_output` like in original function, we create a new list `output`.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output: List[int], max_pos: int, sum_: int) -> List[int]:\n    output = unnormalized_output[:max_pos]  # Select elements till max_pos\n    return vec_scalar_div(sum_, output)     # Divide each element by sum_\n```\n\nThe function softmax_part4 in Python uses list slicing to extract elements from the start till max_pos (just like the for loop did in the original C++ code) and then uses `vec_scalar_div` to divide each of these elements by the sum. Note that, in Python, due to its dynamic nature, we don't need to have an explicit push_back operation or to declare the size of the vector (list in Python) as was needed in the C++ code. \n\nThis Python code does the exact same thing as your original C++ function and should give the same result given the same inputs.",
    "Given function is reading a vector until the maximum position, performing an operation with each element, and returning a new vector. Here is the Python equivalent using the provided function in a Pythonic way:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    result = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n    return result\n```",
    "Given the list of operations available to us in python, the softmax_part4 function in python can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    return vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum]*max_pos)\n```\n\nIn this Python version of your function, by using the slice operator `unnormalized_output[:max_pos]`, we get a sub-vector that only has `max_pos` number of elements from the start of the unnormalized_output vector. Then, `[sum]*max_pos` gives us a vector with length equals to `max_pos` and all elements equals to `sum`. Finally, we element-wise divide the sub-vector by the sum vector using `vec_elemwise_div`.\n",
    "The C++ function can be translated to Python with the given functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part4(unnormalized_output, max_pos, sum):\n    output = vec_elemwise_div(unnormalized_output[:max_pos], [sum] * max_pos)\n    return output\n```\n\nIn this Python version of the function, I used the Python slicing syntax to get the elements in the `unnormalized_output` list up to the `max_pos` index. This operation is similar to the loop in the C++ version that iterates from 0 to `max_pos`. I also used the `vec_elemwise_div` function to divide each of these elements by `sum`, similar to the division operation inside the C++ loop. Note that I had to multiply the `sum` value by `max_pos` to get a list of the same length as `unnormalized_output[:max_pos]`, because the `vec_elemwise_div` function requires two lists of the same length. This list multiplication operation in Python creates a new list with the `sum` value repeated `max_pos` times."
