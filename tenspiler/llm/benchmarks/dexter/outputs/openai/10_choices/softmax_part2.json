    "Here is the Python equivalent function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    partial_input = input[:max_pos]\n    output = vec_map(partial_input, lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output\n```",

If the input is a list of integers, the output should also be a list of integers.",
    "Given your constraints, the `softmax_part2` function can be rewritten in Python as the following function below using `vec_map` and `vec_scalar_sub` functions.\n\n```python\n# Python equivalent of the C++ softmax_part2 function\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    def integer_exp(x):\n        return x\n    \n    # Selecting only the elements upto max_pos\n    input = input[:max_pos]\n    \n    # Performing element-wise subtraction and applying integer_exp\n    output = vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, input), integer_exp)\n    \n    return output\n```\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ `softmax_part2` function. Given a vector `input`, a maximum position `max_pos` and a maximum value `max_val`, it subtracts `max_val` from every element in the input vector up to the position `max_pos`, applies the `integer_exp` function i.e., the identity function, and returns the resulting vector. The use of the provided Python functions makes the function super clean and compact.",
    "Given a C++ function and Python functions, it's assumed that the task is to rewrite the C++ function into Python using the provided Python functions while preserving it's underlying functionality. Here's how it can be done:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Callable\n\n# define integer_exp because it's used in softmax_part2\ndef integer_exp(x: int) -> int: \n    return x\n\n# rewritten softmax_part2 function\ndef softmax_part2(input: List[int], max_pos:int, max_val:int) -> List[int]:\n    # Use list slicing to get first 'max_pos' elements from 'input'\n    input = input[:max_pos]\n    # Use vec_map to apply integer_exp on each element of input and subtract max_val from each element\n    output = vec_map(input, lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output\n```\nSo, this Python function `softmax_part2` behaves same as the provided C++ function. It applies a certain operation on the first `max_pos` elements of the `input` list and return the resulting list. In this operation, it subtracts `max_val` from each element and apply `integer_exp` on the result. In this case, `integer_exp` just returns its input as output because it's defined that way in the C++ function. It will change if any other operation is defined in `integer_exp`.",
    "The `softmax_part2` function is a part of the softmax function in machine learning, which is often used in the final layer of a neural network. It takes partial computation results as input, the maximum position `max_pos` and the maximum value `max_val`. It calculates the exponent of (`input[i] - max_val`) for all `i` from 0 to `max_pos`.\n\nLooking at the mentioned functions and the goal, we need to use `vec_map` and `selection_two_args` functions to achieve the semantics of the `softmax_part2` function.\n\nWe need to select the first `max_pos` elements from `input` and then subtract `max_val` from each of them and apply the `integer_exp` function.\n\nHere is the equivalent function for `softmax_part2`:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    def subtract_max_val(x):\n        return integer_exp(x - max_val)\n\n    input_slice = input[:max_pos]\n    return vec_map(input_slice, subtract_max_val)\n```\n\nHere, we are taking a slice of the `input` vector to get elements till the `max_pos` and then applying the function `subtract_max_val` which is equivalent to the body of the for loop in the original C++ function.\n\nThe usage of `vec_map` allows us to apply a function to every element in the vector. The `subtract_max_val` function is responsible for doing the computation that the original function was doing inside the loop. \n\nNote: Python's built-in `map` function can also be used to do this, but since it was not provided in the list, we've used `vec_map`. Also, make sure `integer_exp` function is properly defined in your context as it was used without being defined in your original C++ code.",
    "The given C++ function `softmax_part2` computes an intermediate step of the softmax function in machine learning. It loops through an input vector up to a maximum position, subtracts a maximum value from each element and applies an exponentiation function (integer_exp), then stores the results in an output vector. \n\nHowever, given the collection of Python functions that are provided, we do not have access to a loop structure or a way to index into an array at a given position. All of our operations must be map or fold/reduce operations. This is a more functional style of programming. \n\nGiven these restrictions, we can translate the `softmax_part2` function to something like the following in Python:\n```\ndef map_int_to_int(x):\n    return integer_exp(x)\n\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    sliced_input = input[:max_pos]  \n    max_value_vector = [max_val for _ in range(len(sliced_input))]\n    sub_vector = vec_elemwise_sub(sliced_input, max_value_vector)\n    output = vec_map(sub_vector, map_int_to_int)\n    return output\n\ndef integer_exp(x): \n    return x\n```\nThis code will start by slicing the input up to `max_pos`. It then creates a vector with the same length as the sliced input, which contains the `max_val` in every position. It subtracts the `max_val` vector from the sliced input vector element-wise, and applies the `integer_exp` function to every element using `vec_map`, which applies a given function to every element of a vector. Here `integer_exp` is defined as a separate function returning the same number as it is a placeholder here, you might want to replace it with actual exponential function for real world usage.\n\nNote that this translation is semantically equivalent to the original code, but it follows a different style of syntax and logic due to the differing capabilities and constraints of C++ and Python.",
    "To rewrite the given C++ function `softmax_part2` into Python, we can use a combination of `slice()` and `vec_map()`. First, we slice the input from 0 to `max_pos`. Then we use `vec_map()` with a lambda function to apply the desired function to every element in the vector.\n\nHere's the rewritten function in Python:\n\n```\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    sliced_input = input[:max_pos]\n    output = vec_map(sliced_input, lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output\n    \ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n```\n\nNote that the `integer_exp` function in C++ simply returns the input as is. In the Python version, I included this function and kept it the same for completeness. However, if it just returns the input, you can remove it and modify the lambda function in `vec_map()`.",
    "The equivalent function using the provided functions in Python would look like this:\n\n```Python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    vec_sub = vec_elemwise_sub(input[:max_pos], vec_scalar_add(max_val, [0]*max_pos))\n    return vec_map(vec_sub, integer_exp)\n```\n\nI made the following assumptions based on your existing C++ function and available Python functions:\n\n1. The function `integer_exp` is assumed to be same as `int`.\n2. The broadcast subtraction operation `input[i] - max_val` in C++ is performed using elementwise vector subtraction `vec_elemwise_sub`.\n3. Before applying `vec_elemwise_sub`, input vector and scalar are first converted to vectors of same length using `vec_scalar_add`.\n4. `vec_map` is used to apply the `integer_exp` function to each element of resulting vector.\n5. Only elements till position `max_pos` are taken for operation by slicing `input[:max_pos]`.",
    "In Python, we can replace the for-loop by using list comprehension in combination with `vec_scalar_sub` function to subtract `max_val` from each element of `input` vector.\n\nNote: Since both the original C++ `integer_exp` function and Python's identity function do basically the same thing (returning the input as it is), I'll skip it in the Python code.\n\nPython code equivalent to the given test function would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input: list, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return vec_scalar_sub(max_val, input[:max_pos])\n```"
