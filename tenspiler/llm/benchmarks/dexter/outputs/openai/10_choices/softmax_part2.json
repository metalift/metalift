    "Here is how you can re-write the `softmax_part2` function:\n\n```python\n#defined function\ndef integer_exp(x): \n    return x\n\ndef softmax_part2(input_, max_pos, max_val):\n    output = vec_map(input_[:max_pos], lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output\n```\nHere, `[input_[:max_pos]` limits the input till the max_pos. `lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val)` is a function which subtracts each element of vector till `max_pos` with `max_val`. `vec_map` then applies this function to each element in the input vector.",
    "Below is the rewritten version of the `test` function in Python:\n```python\ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    output = vec_map(input[:max_pos], lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output\n```\nThe above code utilizes list slicing (input[:max_pos]) to return a python list with only the elements up to max_pos from the original list input. Then, `vec_map` is utilized to apply the function (which subtracts max_val from the given element and passes it into the integer_exp function) element-wise to the sliced input list.",
    "To rewrite the given C++ function using the provided Python functions, we'd have to translate the looping and subtraction operation to equivalent recursive calls in Python. We can achieve this with the 'vec_elemwise_sub' and 'vec_map' functions.\n\nHere is how you can write the `softmax_part2` function using only the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    if max_pos < 1:\n        return []\n    else:\n        updated_input = vec_elemwise_sub(input, vec_scalar_mul(max_val, [1]*len(input)))\n        return vec_map(updated_input[:max_pos], integer_exp)\n```\n\nIn the above function, the line `updated_input = vec_elemwise_sub(input, vec_scalar_mul(max_val, [1]*len(input)))` is equivalent to the operation `input[i] - max_val` in C++. The function `vec_elemwise_sub` is performing element-wise subtraction on the input list with the max_val.\n\nThe line `vec_map(updated_input[:max_pos], integer_exp)` is applying the \"integer_exp\" function on each element of the updated_input list up to the max_pos position. This is equivalent to the loop operation in the C++ function where `integer_exp` is applied to each element of the input list.\n\nPlease note that the above function assumes that an equivalent `integer_exp` function exists in Python. In the C++ function, `integer_exp` appears to be just returning the input. If this is the case, Python's default identity function (lambda x: x) could be used.",
    "Here is the `softmax_part2` function from C++ translated to Python, using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n\n\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    def map_fn(x):\n        return integer_exp(x - max_val)\n\n    return vec_map(input[:max_pos], map_fn)\n```\n\nIn this Python implementation, we first define `integer_exp` at the top level of the module to be globally accessible throughout our program. The `softmax_part2` function brings in a list (vector in C++) as the argument, `input`, along with `max_pos` and `max_val`. \n\nWe define a `map_fn` as a helper function that maps each element `x` in `input` to `integer_exp(x - max_val)`. Then, we apply the `map_fn` to the slice of `input` until `max_pos` using the provided `vec_map` function and return the resulting list.\n\nThis implementation is equivalent to the C++ implementation as they both compute the exact same transformation of the input data.",
    "Based on the provided functions, you can rewrite the `softmax_part2` function in Python as below.\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    # Create the range [0, max_pos)\n    range_max_pos = list(range(max_pos))\n\n    # Define a function that matches the behaviour of integer_exp function in C++\n    def integer_exp(x): return x\n\n    # Subtract max_val from each element in the input and apply integer_exp function\n    sub_and_exp = vec_map(vec_elemwise_sub(input[:max_pos], [max_val]*max_pos), integer_exp)\n    \n    return sub_and_exp\n```\n\nIn this python function, I first create a range that matches the size of the loop in your C++ function. Then I define a function `integer_exp` that mimics the behavior of the C++ function by returning the input value unchanged. It's necessary here because `vec_map` function requires a function as the second argument. Finally, I call `vec_elemwise_sub` function to subtract `max_val` from each element in `input` range and use `vec_map` to apply the `integer_exp` function (which in this case does nothing). That achieves the semantically equivalent operation to your C++ function.",
    "Here are my suggestions for rewriting the C++ function `softmax_part2` using provided functions and constants. \n\nIn the original `softmax_part2` function, a vector `output` is created. For each element `input[i]` of the `input` vector up to `max_pos`, `integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)` is computed and added to the `output` vector. \n\nBelow is the rewritten `softmax_part2` function utilizing the above-stated python functions: \n\n```python\n# redefined the imported function in the following way: \ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    # map the integer_exp operation (which in this case is an identity operation) for each element in the sliced vector\n    output = vec_map(input[:max_pos], lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val)) \n    return output\n```\nThe specified slicing operation `input[:max_pos]` creates a new list that contains the elements from the start of the list up to `max_pos`. The `vec_map` function then applies the lambda function `lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val)` to each element in the sliced list, which is the equivalent to the operation performed inside the for loop in the original C++ code. Hence, the same result will be computed and saved in the `output` variable. \n\nThe function `integer_exp` does not perform any operation since it returns the same number that is passed to it. As such, it can be omitted as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    output = vec_map(input[:max_pos], lambda x: x - max_val) \n    return output\n```\n\nGiven the mentioned redefined functions, this redefined `softmax_part2` function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ `softmax_part2` function.",
    "Based on the function definitions provided, we can rewrite the `test` function as the `softmax_part2` Python function:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    def integer_exp(x): return x\n    return vec_map(input[:max_pos], lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n```\n\nHere it uses:\n\n1. `input[:max_pos]` to get the range of the vector to process, this is equivalent to the for loop in the original function with the `max_pos`.\n\n2. `lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val)` to calculate the new value for each element in the vector, which is equivalent to `integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)` in the original function. `lambda` is a Python keyword used to define small anonymous functions.\n\n3. `vec_map` to apply `integer_exp` to each element in `input[:max_pos]`.\n\nPlease note, to represent a lambda function `integer_exp (x - max_value)` using your defined functions is not feasible. The lambda function involves direct calculations which your defined functions do not permit.",
    "Given your Python functions, we can rewrite the `softmax_part2` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    output = vec_map(input, lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val))\n    return output[:max_pos]\n```\n\nHere's how the rewrite process was done given the limitations:\n\n1. First, notice that `softmax_part2` applies a function to each element of the `input` vector, creating a new `output` vector as a result. This is done using the provided `vec_map` function.\n\n2. `integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)` corresponds to a Python lambda function `lambda x: integer_exp(x - max_val)`, which is applied to each element of the `input` vector.\n\n3. In the C++ version, the loop stops when `i == max_pos`. The equivalent operation in Python would be slicing the list at `max_pos`, which is done using `output[:max_pos]`. \n\nPlease be noted that you should adjust the function `integer_exp` accordingly, as in your C++ code it just returns the input and does nothing. You may want to adjust it to perform actual exponentiation operation (e.g., `def integer_exp(x): return math.exp(x)`).",
    "The `softmax_part2` function in C++ is taking as input a vector of integers and two integers, and returns a new vector, where for each element before `max_pos` it decreases it by `max_val` and applies the function integer_exp to it. This could be replaced by using the `vec_elemwise_sub`, which performs the subtraction part, followed by using `vec_map` to apply the `integer_exp` function:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef integer_exp(x) -> int:\n    return x\n\ndef softmax_part2(input: List[int], max_pos: int, max_val: int) -> List[int]:\n    input_sub = vec_elemwise_sub(input[:max_pos], [max_val]*max_pos)\n    return vec_map(input_sub, integer_exp)\n```\nPlease note the implementation is in Python and in the original `integer_exp` function in C++ it does not actually perform any exponential operation, it simply returns the input as is. Ensure this function is doing the expected work in your program. Also note that the `vec_elemwise_sub` and `vec_map` functions are not able to handle input vectors of different lengths and you must ensure the vectors are of the same length before using these functions. In this version of `softmax_part2` function, we\u2019re taking a slice of the input list up to `max_pos` and duplicating `max_val` to create a new list of the same length for element-wise subtraction. Therefore, it's important that `max_pos` is a valid index in the `input` list.",
    "Based on the provided functions, the equivalent Python function for `softmax_part2` looks like this:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part2(input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return vec_map(vec_elemwise_sub(input[:max_pos], vec_scalar_add(max_val, [0]*max_pos)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nPlease note that Python slicing is inclusive at heading and exclusive at tail (a:b includes a and excludes b). So input[:max_pos] would give elements from 0 up to (max_pos-1), which should behave similar to the given C++ function.\n\nvec_map here is specifying the function to apply to every element in the vector, and integer_exp is same as the function in the original code.\nvec_elemwise_sub is subtracting max_val from each element in sublist input[:max_pos]. I have used scalar addition function vec_scalar_add to create a vector of max_val which is subtracted from the original vector.\nFinally, vec_map specifies the function integer_exp to apply to every element of the subtracted vector which is same as original behaviour of the function."
