    "The rewritten code of function \"color_burn_8\" in Python is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n\n    # Define a function that can be passed to selection_two_args to perform the color burn formula.\n    def color_burn_formula(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 0 else 255 - (255 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n\n    # Call to the library function to perform the color burn operation on base and active pixel matrices.\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn_formula)\n```\nAs you can see, in the function `color_burn_8`,  we return the function `matrix_selection_two_args` where we pass `base`, `active` and a function `color_burn_formula` which perform the operation `255 - (255 - base_pixel) // active_pixel` on each asset of our `base` and `active` matrix. If active pixel equals 0, we will return 255 else we do the normal calculation. \n\nThe approach used in the `color_burn_8` is called functional programming where functions, or methods, from the Math module are passed as parameters to other functions.",
    "Your equivalent python function using your provided set of functions would look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def color_burn_single_pixel(basePixel, activePixel):\n        if activePixel == 0:\n            return 255\n        else:\n            return 255 - vec_scalar_div(255 - basePixel, activePixel)[0]\n        \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn_single_pixel)\n```\n\nThis Python function uses the `color_burn_single_pixel` function to apply the color burn effect to an individual pixel. This function is then used as the args selector in `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply the color burn effect to the entire matrix. Note, `matrix_selection_two_args` function takes matrix `base`, matrix `active` and a function (`color_burn_single_pixel` in our case) to compute the resultant matrix. The function passed will be applied on each corresponding pair of elements in matrices `base` and `active`. \n\nNOTE: `vec_scalar_div` function is used but this will not handle division by zero case, make sure you do not have zero in active matrix to avoid this. \n\nAlso, The original C++ code is written specifically for processing RGB images, where pixel intensities can range from 0-255. The Python code above mimics this behaviour, therefore, the inputs for this function should have the same constraints.",
    "The provided C++ code can be translated into Python using the provided functions in the following way:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def color_burn_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        # C++: if (active_pixel == 0) pixel = 255;\n        pixel_if_active_zero = 255\n        # C++: else pixel = 255 - (255 - base_pixel) / active_pixel;\n        pixel_if_active_non_zero = vec_scalar_sub(255, vec_elemwise_div(vec_scalar_sub(255, base_pixel), active_pixel))\n        # combine: if active_pixel == 0, use pixel_if_active_zero, else pixel_if_active_non_zero\n        return pixel_if_active_zero if active_pixel == 0 else pixel_if_active_non_zero\n\n    # use provided function matrix_selection_two_args, apply color_burn_pixel on each corresponding pair of base and active pixels\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn_pixel)\n```\nThe outer function `color_burn_8` takes two inputs - `base` and `active`. There is also an inner function defined `color_burn_pixel` that implements the logic for individual pixels (given a single value from the `base` matrix and `active` matrix). The function `matrix_selection_two_args` then applies this function to every pair of corresponding elements from `base` and `active` matrices.\nThis Python code will execute the same logic as the C++ code and is semantically the same.\nPlease note that because the Python code is using a high-level language feature (high order function `matrix_selection_two_args`), there is no loop needed in the Python code. The function `matrix_selection_two_args` internally uses recursion to process each pair of elements from the `base` and `active` matrices.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python function using the provided functions. This function emulates the color_burn_8() function where we are applying the color burn from the \"active\" matrix onto the \"base\" matrix.\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def color_burn(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 0 else 255 - (255 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn)\n```\n\nThis python function takes 2D arrays \"base\" and \"active\" and applies the function `color_burn` to corresponding elements in \"base\" and \"active\". The function `color_burn` takes the base pixel and active pixel and computes the new pixel value as per the given formula in the C++ function. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the `color_burn` function to corresponding elements of the two argument matrices.",
    "To rewrite the provided C++ function in the given Python constraints, you'll need to take into account the Python indices assertions and divisions mechanism. Also, the equivalent of using if-else while transpiling the C++ function to Python function would be by using selection_two_args for deciding whether active[row][col] is equal to 0 or not.\n\nGiven the C++ function, the Python equivalent function by using the provided functions would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def map_int_base_active(base_val, active_val):\n        if active_val == 0:\n            return 255\n        else:\n            return 255 - (255 - base_val) // active_val\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, map_int_base_active)\n```\n\nThis Python function takes two arguments, 'base' and 'active', which are the matrix representations. The function 'color_burn_8' applies the blend mode operation to each element of the 'base' and 'active' using the 'matrix_selection_two_args' function. It also checks if the 'active_val' is equal to 0 or not, if it is, it return 255 else it performs the equivalent operation of the 'pixel' variable in the C++ function.\n\nPlease note that in Python, the division operator '/' performs floating-point division, while '//' performs integer (floor) division, so '//' is used here for integer division to more closely match the behavior of the division in the original C++ code which is integer division.",
    "Here is the semantically equivalent python function to the C++ `color_burn_8` function using your set of provided functions and constants:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    \n    def select_two_args_arg(base_val, active_val):\n        return 255 if active_val == 0 else 255 - (255 - base_val) // active_val\n\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n    return out\n```\nThis Python function (`color_burn_8`) is semantically equivalent to the C++ example given in your question (`color_burn_8`). Main difference is that C++ example is mutating the 2D vector in place via loop iterations, whereas Python is taking a more functional approach, creating a new list and avoiding in-place mutations. The select_two_args_arg function is created to replicate the behaviour of if-else condition in the loop and used with `matrix_selection_two_args` to give the expected result.",
    "Here is your C++ function rewritten with your provided set of Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def color_burn_func(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 0 else 255 - (255 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn_func)\n```",
    "The equivalent Python function using only high-level vector-oriented functions, without explicit for-loops and conditions is this:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    # create a func that applies the color burn effect for a pair of pixels.\n    def color_burn(b, a):\n        if a == 0:\n            return 255\n        else:\n            return 255 - (255 - b) // a\n    \n    # propagate the function to all corresponding pairs of pixels in base and active.\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn)\n```\nThis function uses as input the base and active matrices, then applies the color_burn operation to element pairs from the base and active matrices. The operation to be performed on each pair of elements is embedded in the color_burn function and matrix_selection_two_args is then called to iterate over the base and active matrices and apply the operation.",
    "You can rewrite the C++ `test` function using the python functions provided as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def color_burn_pixel_fn(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 0 else 255 - (255 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_burn_pixel_fn)\n```\n\nIn the python function `color_burn_8`, we constructed a pixel-by-pixel `color_burn_pixel_fn` that gets passed into `matrix_selection_two_args`. Each pixel from the base and the active matrices is processed with `color_burn_pixel_fn`. This process is akin to the nested for-loop in the original C++ function. It applies the \"Color Burn\" operation on each pixel, which brightens the base pixel using the active pixel. If the active pixel is `0`, then the output pixel is `255`. Otherwise, the output pixel subtracts the division of `(255 - base_pixel)` by `active_pixel` from `255`. This is analogous to the corresponding calculation in the C++ function.\n",
    "The C++ test function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions and constants as follows:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args_arg(base, active):\n    if active == 0:\n        return 255\n    else:\n        return 255 - (255 - base) // active\n\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThis Python program uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the `select_two_args_arg` function to every pair of corresponding elements in the base and active matrices. The `select_two_args_arg` function imitates the logic in the pixel calculation in your provided C++ function."
