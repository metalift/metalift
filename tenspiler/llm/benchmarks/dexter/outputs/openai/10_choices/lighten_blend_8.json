    "The C++ lighten_blend_8 function can be replaced using provided python functions as follows\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```  \n\npseudo-code\n```\nfunction lighten_blend_8(base: 2D-Array, active: 2D-Array)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis is equivalent because \n\n- both the C++ and Python functions iterate through the two input 2D arrays (or matrices)\n\n- both calculate a new pixel value as the maximum pixel value at each (row, col) position among the two 2D arrays (or matrices) \n\n- the Python function matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max) selects the maximum of base[i][j] and active[i][j] which is equivalent to the C++ code \n\n```\nif (base[row][col] < active[row][col])\n    pixel = active[row][col];\nelse\n    pixel = base[row][col];\n```\n\n- in the case active[row][col] >= base[row][col], the 'active' pixel is chosen\n\n- in the case active[row][col] < base[row][col], the 'base' pixel is chosen\n\n- in both cases, the maximum pixel is chosen, which is captured in the Python code by using the 'max' function as the third argument of the matrix_selection_two_args function\n\n- both versions then return the result as a new 2D array or matrix",
    "In Python, you can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with max as select_two_args_arg because it will compare each corresponding element from two matrices and return a matrix with max of both elements.\n\nHere is the Python equivalent of your C++ test function:\n\n```Python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n``` \n\nThe function `lighten_blend_8` will iterate through the `base` and `active` matrices (assumed to be the same size), comparing each corresponding element and selecting the max. This is the same as what the lighten_blend_8 function was doing in the C++ version.",
    "The equivalent Python function will use the predefined `matrix_selection_two_args` function along with the `max` Python built-in function. The function `max` will act as `select_two_args_arg` since max(a, b) function perfectly corresponds to comparing two elements and choose the maximum one.\n```\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function iterates over two given matrices (base and active in this case) and returns a new matrix where each element is computed by applying the `max` function to the corresponding elements of the two matrices. This behaviour matches the behaviour of the given C++ test function.\n\nOnce we compared each pixel base[row][col] and active[row][col] and took the brighter one, we added it to out[row], which we constructed by repeating the process for each pixel in the row. As a result, we kept the brighter pixel.\n\nBecause the matrix_selection_two_args function repeats this process for every row in the provided matrix, the result is equivalent to the goal of the original C++ test function.",
    "The function `lighten_blend_8` in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions like this:\n\nThe function takes in two 2D vectors or matrices: `base` and `active`. It iterates through the elements of the matrices which are at the same positions in both matrices and selects the maximum one. This operation is equivalent to `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `max` function as `select_two_args_arg`.\n\nPython function:\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\nNote that the behavior of this python function is identical to the provided `lighten_blend_8` function in C++. Both iterate over the elements in the same positions of the two input matrices, compare them, and keep the maximum value.",
    "The given C++ function `lighten_blend_8` compares each pixel in two images, and chooses the brighter of the two. The function accepts two 2D vectors (representing images) as input and returns a 2D vector.\n\nThe given function is semantically equivalent to the function `matrix_selection_two_args` when the selection function `select_two_args_arg` follows the logic:\n\n    Return the larger of the two arguments. This is equivalent to the logic of `max` function in Python.\n\nHere is the function `lighten_blend_8` rewritten using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nHere, the `max` function is used as the selection function `select_two_args_arg` for `matrix_selection_two_args` method which follows the intended comparison logic (choose the larger of the two) expressed in the original C++ function. This will return a new matrix where each element is the larger of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`.",
    "```\n# Python version\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    select_two_args_arg = max\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```",
    "The `lighten_blend_8` function is actually doing element-wise maximum on two 2-dimensional vectors, or in other words, matrices. The provided functions have provided a `matrix_selection_two_args` function that we can utilize to perform this element-wise maximum operation. The function in question is rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom operator import max\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nIn the rewritten python function `lighten_blend_8`, the function `matrix_selection_two_args` is used, which performs a selected operation (in this case - maximum) between the two input matrices. This is semantically equivalent to your provided C++ function. The returned result is a matrix that contains the maximum value at each corresponding position from the two input matrices. \n\nPlease note that the `max` function from `operator` module is used because the `select_two_args_arg` parameter in `matrix_selection_two_args` needs to be a function that accepts two arguments and returns a value. If a function of such type is not available, you will need to define one separately.",
    "The `lighten_blend_8` function is comparing pixel by pixel between two images, `base` and `active`. It then chooses the maximum value for each corresponding pixel and generates a new image.\n\nIn functional programming, this can be achieved by `matrix_selection_two_args` function with Python's builtin `max` function as `select_two_args_arg`.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n  return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\nThis function achieves the same effect as the `lighten_blend_8` function in the original C++ code. It returns a new image (a 2D array) built from the maximum pixel values between the base image and the active image.",
    "Here is the function `lighten_blend_8` rewritten to utilize the provided operations:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis function uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function to operate on each pair of corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices. \n\nFor each pair of elements, `matrix_selection_two_args` applies the `max` function, which is equivalent to selecting the larger of the two values -- this mirrors the behavior of the comparison and assignment in the original `lighten_blend_8` function.\n\nIt's important to note that `max` works the same as described in the original C++ function. => `max(a, b)` gets the maximum value between `a` and `b` which mimics the if-else condition in the C++ function.",
    "The C++ function `lighten_blend_8` selects and takes the maximum value between each corresponding elements of two 2D vectors named `base` and `active`, and returns this new 2D vector. In Python, we have the defined function `matrix_selection_two_args` that does exactly this. Here's the equivalent Python function using your defined functions:\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    # For 2D vectors, this selection function returns the maximum of each corresponding element in the two vectors\n    def select_max(a, b):\n        return max(a, b)\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_max)\n```"
