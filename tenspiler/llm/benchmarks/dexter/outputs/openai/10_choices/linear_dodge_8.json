    "To translate the given C++ function 'linear_dodge_8' into Python, we use the provided matrix_elemwise_add function. 'matrix_elemwise_add' is chosen because it performs element-wise addition of two matrices, which is the equivalent operation as the one being performed in the 'linear_dodge_8' function.\n\nHere is the Python equivalent of the 'linear_dodge_8' function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```",
    "Given that the `linear_dodge_8` function performs an element-wise addition of two 2D vectors (or matrices), it can be rewritten using the defined `matrix_elemwise_add` function. Here's the corresponding Python code:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis new version performs the same operation as the original C++ function, but in this case we're using Python and making use of function definitions provided. Both versions apply an element-wise addition operation to two matrices.",
    "The given C++ `linear_dodge_8` function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows. It uses the `matrix_elemwise_add` function which sums each corresponding element in two matrices.\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nThis Python function will behave exactly the same as the C++ function. It will take two 2D lists (matrices) as input and returns a 2D list (matrix) as result where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from input matrices.",
    "The given `test` function in C++ can be translated to Python using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function that you provided. This Python function performs elementwise addition on two matrices, which seems to be exactly what `linear_dodge_8` function is doing.\n\nHere is my Python version:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_elemwise_add` function goes through each element in the `base` and `active` matrices, adding them together respectively, which mirrors the function of the `linear_dodge_8` function, where each pixel value in the `base` matrix is added to its corresponding value in the `active` matrix. The result is a new matrix (`out`) that consists of the added pixel values.  This is exact semantic equivalent of your `test` C++ function in Python.",
    "The C++ function `linear_dodge_8` can be converted into Python by using the defined function `matrix_elemwise_add`.\n\nThis Python function operates on two matrices and applies the element-wise addition operation which aligns with the behavior of the given C++ function.\n\nHere's how to rewrite the C++ function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```",
    "Based on the given functions and constants, the equivalent function in Python is:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8_python(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```",
    "The given `test` function in C++ is performing an element-wise sum of two matrices. In Python, you can achieve this by using the function `matrix_elemwise_add`.\n\nHere is the Python version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThe function `linear_dodge_8` takes two parameters: `base` and `active`, which are 2d lists (or matrices). It then simply adds the two matrices using the predefined function `matrix_elemwise_add`. The returned result is the sum of the two input matrices.\n\nNote: I assumed that the matrices `base` and `active` are of the same size since your `test` function was adding them directly. If there is a chance that the matrices have different sizes, make sure to handle such cases.",
    "The provided C++ function `linear_dodge_8` takes two 2-dimensional vectors (which are essentially matrices in this context), `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix that has the same dimensionality and where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from `base` and `active`.\n\nSince the output depends on an element-wise addition operation, we could rewrite this function by using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function defined above. Here's how the transformation looks like in Python:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis function does exactly what the original C++ function does, but in a more compact way. `matrix_elemwise_add` traverses through each element in `base` and `active`, adds the corresponding elements together, and combines the results into a new matrix, which is then returned.",
    "The `linear_dodge_8` function can be alternatively written in Python using the function `matrix_elemwise_add` from the given functions. The function `matrix_elemwise_add` performs element-wise addition of two matrices (or 2D vectors as in this context). This is equivalent to the operation performed in `linear_dodge_8` function.\n\nHere is the Python equivalent:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nThis function takes in two 2D vectors, `base` and `active`, as inputs and returns their element-wise sum using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function. Note that this is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function, just implemented in a different language with a different set of functions.",
    "The test function `linear_dodge_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThe function `linear_dodge_8` computes the element-wise addition of two matrices `base` and `active`, which is equivalent to adding the corresponding elements of `base` and `active` in the given C++ function."
