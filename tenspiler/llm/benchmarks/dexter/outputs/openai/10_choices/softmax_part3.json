    "Given function 'softmax_part3' in C++ performs sum of elements in vector 'output' up to 'max_pos' index. Let's rewrite it in Python using the available function 'reduce_sum' which takes an array as input and returns sum of all elements of array.\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```",
    "Here is how you can rewrite the given `test` function in Python using the functions and utilities that are provided to you:\n\n```python\n\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n\n```\n\nExplanation: \nWe are using the `reduce_sum` function, which sums up all the values in the input list. In the context of the given function, we slice the list from index 0 to `max_pos` (non-inclusive), using Python's list slicing syntax `output[:max_pos]`. This sliced list replicates the functionality of the original for-loop iterating from 0 to `max_pos` in the given `softmax_part3` function.",
    "The original C++ function is accumulating terms from a vector up until a certain position. We can achieve the same effect in Python by slicing the list up until `max_pos` and then using the `reduce_sum` function on the resulting slice.\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```",
    "The `softmax_part3` function is calculating the sum of the first `max_pos` elements of the `output` vector. We can use the `reduce_sum` function for this. We would first have to slice the `output` list to get the first `max_pos` elements and then apply `reduce_sum` on this sliced list.\n\nPython equivalent:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    sliced_output = output[:max_pos]\n    return reduce_sum(sliced_output)\n```  \n\nPlease note that there is no direct equivalent of the C++ function `softmax_part3` using the provided Python function set. As an expert in programming languages, I would advise that to properly adapt the function from C++ to the given Python functions, one would need a slicing function which can slice the list to `max_pos` number of elements. The simple slice operation `[:max_pos]` in Python doesn't have a direct equivalent in the given Python function set.",
    "You can rewrite the \"softmax_part3\" C++ function using \"reduce_sum\" and slicing in Python. \"reduce_sum\" function will do the sum of all elements in a list and slicing allows you to access the part of the list which in needed. So, using python you simply need to slice the list till \"max_pos\" and use \"reduce_sum\" to sum all of the elements till that position.\n\nHere is equivalent Python function using only your defined functions:\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\nPlease note that in Python, the end index in slicing is exclusive.",
    "Based on the provided functions and constants, the C++ function `softmax_part3` can be rewritten in Python as:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same thing as the C++ function -- it sums up all the elements in the vector `output` up to the position `max_pos`. \n\nIt uses the provided function `reduce_sum()`. This function takes as input a list and returns the sum of the elements in that list. \n\nThe Python function uses slicing (`output[:max_pos]`) to get the elements from the beginning of the list up to (but not including) the position `max_pos`. This sliced list is then passed to `reduce_sum()`.",
    "The given `softmax_part3` function in C++ can be replaced using the provided Python functions by using the `reduce_sum` function. This function is used to compute the sum of a list of numbers.\n\nThe Python equivalent function for the above provided test function would be:\n\n```\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nIn the given C++ function, it is iterating over `output` from first element till `max_pos` (exclusive) and adding each number to the sum, this operation is equivalent to the above python function where it slices the list `output` from the first element till `max_pos` (exclusive) and then finds the sum of all elements in the slice using `reduce_sum`.\n",
    "Here is your `softmax_part3` function written using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nIn this function, we're taking the sum of all elements from the output vector up to the `max_pos` position. To implement this, I'm using the `reduce_sum` function and Python's slice notation to create a sub-array from the `output` array up to the `max_pos` position (0-indexed, exclusive).",
    "You can rewrite the given `test` function using the `reduce_sum` and python list slicing. Here is the equivalent function in python:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[0:max_pos])\n```\n\nIn this function, `output[0:max_pos]` slices the list 'output' from 0^th^ index up to 'max_pos' index (not inclusive) and then `reduce_sum` sums up all the elements in this slice. This function is semantically equivalent to the original `test` function in C++.",
    "The C++ function `softmax_part3` calculates the sum of the elements in the `output` vector up to the `max_pos` index.\n\nTo rewrite this using the defined Python functions you provided, you can use the `reduce_sum` function, which calculates the sum of a list of numbers. Since you need to sum up to `max_pos`, you first take a slice of `output` up to `max_pos`, then pass this to `reduce_sum`:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output, max_pos):\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same as the given C++ function, using only the predefined set of functions.\n\nPlease, note, given defined functions don't include standard Python slicing, so if we are allowed to use only defined functions, this task is impossible, because there is no function that would iterate over the list only till some index."
