    "You can rewrite the `rmsnorm_part2` function using the provided helper functions as follows:\n\n```Python\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 / integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)\n    return output\n\n\ndef integer_sqrt(x):\n    return math.isqrt(x)\n```\nThis Python version of the function performs the same operations as the original C++ version. It first computes the value of `inv_ss` and then multiplies each element of the `input` vector by `inv_ss` and the corresponding element of the `weight` vector. The result of this operation is stored in the `output` variable. Note that integer division is used in the computation of `inv_ss`, as in the original C++ version.\n\nThe `integer_sqrt` function is also included, as it is used by the `rmsnorm_part2` function. Note that the Python `math.isqrt` function is used here to compute the integer square root, which matches the behavior of the original C++ function.",
    "Based on provided functional Python functions, the `rmsnorm_part2` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef integer_sqrt(x):\n    return x\n\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight)\n    return vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, output)\n```\n\nThis function does exactly the same thing as the C++ function `rmsnorm_part2()`. It creates the `output` array by element-wise multiplying the `input` and `weight` arrays, and then multiplies each element of this `output` array by `inv_ss`. Here, `//` is used for integer division in Python similar to `/` in C++. In the Python function, the `vec_elemwise_mul()` and `vec_scalar_mul()` functions provided are used to replace the loop from the C++ function, which makes the code more concise and easier to read.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python function, coded using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(size + 1, vec_scalar_mul(ss, [1]*size))\n    inv_ss_sqrt = vec_map(inv_ss, math.sqrt)\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(inv_ss_sqrt, vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight))\n    return output\n```\nThe initial integer_sqrt function wasn't used, but the Python math.sqrt successfully replaced it. The product of `inv_ss * input[i] * weight[i]` was achieved by equivalent vector elementwise multiplication operations. Finally, to divide ss/ss.size the scalar_vec_div and vec_scalar_mul functions were used instead of direct division.",
    "Here is the Python version of your C++ function, rewritten using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    \n    def integer_sqrt(x): \n        return x\n\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(integer_sqrt(reduce_div([ss, size]) + 1), [1])\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input, vec_elemwise_mul(weight, inv_ss))\n``` \n\nThis function first computes `inv_ss` by dividing 1 over the square root of `ss` divided by the size of the input vector plus 1. We use `scalar_vec_div` to perform division.\n\nAfterward, it performs an element-wise multiplication of the input vector and the weight vector. This is done with the helper function `vec_elemwise_mul`. The result of this operation is further multiplied by `inv_ss` using `vec_elemwise_mul` again.\n\nThe result of these computations is returned as the output of the function.",
    "Here is your function rewritten using the given set of provided functions. This Python function will perform the exact operations that your C++ function does.\n\n```python\n\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    inv_ss = 1 / sqrt(ss / len(input) + 1)\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)\n    return output\n\n```\nIn this Python function, I first calculate the inverse of the square root of `(ss/size + 1)`, where `size` is obtained by finding the length of the input vector. This operation is equivalent to the calculation of `inv_ss` in your original C++ code.\n\nNext, I multiply the `inv_ss` scalar to the input vector using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. This is equivalent to the `input[i]` in your original loop.\n\nFinally, I multiply the output of the previous operation to the weight vector, using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function, which is equivalent to multiplying `input[i] * weight[i]` in the original loop. The output of this operation is returned from the function.",
    "The C++ function rmsnorm_part2 multiplies each element of two given vectors, then multiplies the result to 1 divided by square root of (ss/size + 1). The Python equivalent function using only the given functions and constants can be like the following.\n```python\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(integer_sqrt(int(ss / size + 1)), [1])\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight)\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(inv_ss, output)\n```\nThe Python code follows the same logic as the original C++ function. It calculates the size (length) of the input list, calculates inv_ss, then multiplies each element in two input lists element-wise. It then scales the resulting list by multiplying it with inv_ss. \n\nNote: In your built in functions, you haven't provided integer_sqrt function. If it is not available, the sqrt function from Python's math library can be used.",
    "Here's the rewritten Python function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef integer_sqrt(x):\n    return x\n\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(integer_sqrt(scalar_vec_div(ss, [size])[0] + 1), [1])[0]\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)\n```",
    "Given your defined functions written in Python language and the C++ `rmsnorm_part2` function, according to problem constraints, `rmsnorm_part2` can be rewritten using the defined functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 // math.sqrt(ss // size + 1)\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input, vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight))\n```\nThis function performs the same operations as the original one: \n1. Computes `inv_ss` inverse square root \n2. After that it multiplies each element of the input by `inv_ss`. \n3. Finally, it multiplies the results element-wise with the weight vector. \n\nBut note this Python code could work quite differently from the C++ code on some edge cases due to integer divisions in Python and C++ have different behaviors: in Python, the result is always a float while in C++, the decimal part is discarded, and the result is an integer. Also, please ensure that the helper functions `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_scalar_mul` have been properly defined and imported.",
    "You can rewrite the rmsnorm_part2 function using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef map_square_root(x):\n  return integer_sqrt(x)\n\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n  size = len(input)\n  inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(1, vec_map([ss / size + 1], map_square_root))\n\n  return vec_elemwise_mul(input, vec_elemwise_mul(weight, inv_ss))\n```\n\nNote: \n- The map_square_root function is used to apply integer_sqrt to all elements within a list. \n- The vec_elemwise_mul function is used to element wise multiply the elements of two lists.\n- The scalar_vec_div function is used to divide a scalar by every element of a vector (list). Here, we are providing a list to the second argument so it's basically just performing scalar division. Since sqrt() and division are not provided in the functions, we use the workaround of vec_map() and scalar_vec_div().\n- The resulting output will be list with the same size as the input and weight, with output[i] being equal to inv_ss * input[i] * weight[i]. The function is equivalent to the rmsnorm_part2 function in c++.",
    "Here is a Python translation of your C++ function using the provided set of functions in Python:\n\n```python\ndef integer_sqrt(x): return x\n\ndef rmsnorm_part2(input, weight, ss):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)\n    output = vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)\n    return output\n```\n\nHere the C++ `/` operator is converted to `//` in Python for integer division. The `vec_elemwise_mul` function is used to perform the multiplication of each element in `input` and `weight` vectors. The `vec_scalar_mul` function is used to multiply each element in the `input` by `inv_ss`."
