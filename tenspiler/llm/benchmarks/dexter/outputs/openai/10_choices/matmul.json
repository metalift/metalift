    "Here is how you can rewrite the `matmul` function using the helper functions provided to you. The `matmul` function is essentially performing a matrix-vector multiplication operation. The provided `matrix_vec_mul` Python function can do this:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\nThe `matrix_vec_mul` function multiplies each row of the matrix `weight` with the vector `input`, hence yielding the same semantics of the C++ `matmul` function.",
    "Below is the Python version of the `matmul` function by using the given functions from your set. The equivalent function is `matrix_vec_mul`.\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThe function `matrix_vec_mul` performs the same computation you described: It traverses the given matrix (named `weight` here) and for each row of the matrix it multiplies the corresponding values of the given vector (named `input` here) and then it sums up these multiplied values. The resulting vector is the output you want. The function name 'matrix_vec_mul' is a commonly used abbreviation for 'Matrix-Vector Multiplication'.",
    "Below is your requested reimplementation of the `matmul` function in Python using the provided list of function definitions. The given C++ function performs a matrix multiplication between a matrix and a vector. In this case, the Python function `matrix_vec_mul` can be used to achieve the same functionality.\n\nWith the provided functions, `matmul` can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that matrix_vec_mul function is based on recursion in Python which could lead to maximum recursion depth error for larger inputs. As a result, the original C++ code might be more efficient for larger inputs due to iterative nature of the function.\n",
    "The C++ `matmul` function is performing a matrix-vector multiplication. This translates directly to the `matrix_vec_mul` defined Python function. Hence, the equivalent Python code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThis `matmul` Python function is semantically equivalent to the given `matmul` C++ function. It takes in a 2D list of integers `weight` and a list of integers `input`, and returns a list of integers as output.",
    "Unfortunately, your given functions are defined in Python which is a language with a different syntax from C++ which your `test` function is written in. Due to the difference in syntax and standard libraries, it's impossible to convert your `test` function using the provided Python functions directly in C++. However, if we do have to convert the `test` function using Python semantics and functions, a possible solution could be:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThis uses the `matrix_vec_mul` function from the Python functions you've provided, which essentially performs the required matrix-vector multiplication as is done in your C++ `test` function. The rows of your weight matrix correspond to the rows in the original function and the input vector corresponds to the input vector in the original function. \n\nPlease note that it's always important to understand the context of certain programming languages while transforming functions as some functions cannot be translated verbatim due to differences in language design and standard libraries.",
    "The C++ `matmul` function performs matrix multiplication. This operation can be represented using available Python functions. Specifically, we can use matrix_vec_mul function which multiplies a matrix with a vector, which is semantically equivalent to the \"matmul\" function in the given C++ code.\n\nHere's the Python equivalent of the given C++ test function, given the set of already defined Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThe \"matrix_vec_mul\" function multiplies each element in a row of the matrix with the corresponding element in the vector and adds them up to produce a single output value for that row. This process is repeated for each row in the matrix. The output is a vector whose elements are these output values. This is exactly what the C++ function 'matmul' does.",
    "```\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "The given `test` function in C++ performs the matrix-vector multiplication of a given 2D `weight` matrix and a 1D `input` vector. It iteratively multiplies and adds up the corresponding elements of each row of the matrix and the vector, and stores the results in the `output` vector.\n\nLooking at the provided Python functions, the `matrix_vec_mul()` function performs this operation, so we can use it directly to rewrite the `test` function:\n\nPython equivalent:\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "Below is the equivalent Python version of the given C++ `matmul` function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nIn the `matmul` C++ function, the inner for-loop was multiplying the weight and input column-wise and summing them up. The outer for-loop was then aggregating these sums row-wise into the output vector. All this operation is equivalent to the matrix and vector multiplication, `matrix_vec_mul` function in Python.",
    "Below is the python version of `matmul` function using provided set of functions. It matmul's each row of the weight with input vector and stores the sum into output vector. Please note, the used function `matrix_vec_mul` is self recursive, meaning it continues processing until no row is left in the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```"
