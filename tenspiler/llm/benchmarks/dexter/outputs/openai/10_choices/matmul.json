    "The `matmul` function performs matrix-vector multiplication. It multiplies each row of the `weight` matrix with the `input` vector and gives a vector as the output. Here, the `matrix_vec_mul` function defined above can be used to accomplish this. The matrix multiplication can be defined as follows.\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "Here is a Python equivalent of the provided `matmul` function using available helper functions:\n\n``` python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return reduce_sum(matrix_vec_mul(weight, input))\n``` \n\nIn this `matmul` function, you are taking the dot product of each row of the matrix `weight` with the vector `input`. The helper function `matrix_vec_mul` does exactly this operation by multiplying each row of a given matrix with a vector, and the `reduce_sum` function returns the sum of the resultant list, which simulates the behavior of summing up the results of multiplication in the `matmul` C++ function. Thus, this python version performs matrix-vector multiplication just like the given C++ function does.",
    "The equivalent function using provided functions for the given `test` function in C++ can be redesign as follows, using the `matrix_vec_mul` function:\n\nAssuming the function name to stay the same (i.e., matmul): \n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThe function `matrix_vec_mul` implements the exact behavior of the provided C++ `matmul` function. It multiplies a matrix with a vector, which is the same as what the `matmul` function does. For each row of the matrix, it multiplies the corresponding elements with the vector and sums these multiplication results up, just like the nested for loop in the C++ function.",
    "The `matmul` function in C++ performs matrix-vector multiplication. Thus, it can be written with the provided `matrix_vec_mul` function.\n\nMaking the assumption that the C++ and Python functions use the same type of data structure (nested lists for matrices, lists for vectors), the rewritten `matmul` function would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "The `matmul` C++ function performs a matrix-vector multiplication. It accepts a 2D vector (\"matrix\") and a 1D vector (\"input\") as input, and returns a 1D vector (\"output\") which is the result of the matrix multiplication.\n\nIn Python, this function can be rewritten using the `matrix_vec_mul` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_vec_mul` function performs element-wise multiplication between each row of the matrix (weight) and the input vector, summing these products to produce each element of the output vector. This is equivalent to the operation performed within the nested loops in the C++ `matmul` function. It does not require the use of any other provided functions or constants.",

Based on the functions provided, the equivalent Python function using a single return statement would be `matrix_vec_mul` which applies a matrix-vector multiplication operation. \n\nHere is how you can translate the matmul function:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
