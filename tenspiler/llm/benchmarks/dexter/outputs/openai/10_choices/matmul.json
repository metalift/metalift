    "The given `matmul` function defined in C++ language is a simple matrix multiplication function. It takes a 2D matrix (\"weight\"), a 1D vector (\"input\"), and calculates the product and returns a 1D vector (\"output\"). \n\nThe equivalent function expressed using the given Python functions would be the `matrix_vec_mul` function, as it follows the same logic of matrix-vector multiplication.\n\nHere is the equivalent function:\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "The required Python function using the defined functions can be written as:\n\n```\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\nThe `matrix_vec_mul` function is performing the element wise multiplication between each row of `matrix_x`(which is `weight` in \"matmul\") and `y`(which is `input` in \"matmul\") and summing them up which is equivalent to matrix multiplication in your C++ code.",
    "Here is your rewritten function using the provided functions and constants.\n\n```Python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThis `matmul` function will perform matrix-vector multiplication (which is exactly what the original C++ function does) using the `matrix_vec_mul` function provided, meaning that the weight matrix is multiplied by the input vector.",
    "The given C++ function `matmul` performs matrix-vector multiplication. The provided Python functions include `matrix_vec_mul` which can be used to achieve the same result. So, the semantically equivalent code will be:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThis Python function takes the weight matrix and the input vector as arguments and returns the result of their multiplication by calling the given `matrix_vec_mul` function. The output will be identical to the original C++ function.",
    "You can use the `matrix_vec_mul` function to rewrite the `matmul` function. Here is the equivalent Python function using your defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nYour `matrix_vec_mul` function performs exactly the same operation as the matrix multiplication (`matmul`) function in C++. It multiplies each element of a row in the matrix with the corresponding element in the vector, sums the result, and appends it to the return list. This operation is performed for each row in the matrix.",
    "You can rewrite the provided `matmul` function in C++ to Python using the `matrix_vec_mul` function from the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "The semantically equivalent function in Python is `matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)`.\n\nThis function multiplies a given vector with a matrix, and is the equivalent of the matmul function in C++. It iterates over the rows of the matrix (as the outer loop of matmul does) and for each row, it returns a multiplication of the row and the input (as the inner loop of matmul does). The result is pushed to the output array, which is then returned. The Python implementation is recursive and uses a list comprehension for multiplying the vectors. It is compact and efficient.",
    "The `matmul` function in C++ takes a 2D array `weight` and a 1D array `input` as inputs, then performs the mathematical operation known as matrix-vector multiplication on those inputs. The resulting output is a 1D vector.\n\nBelow is the equivalent Python version of the `matmul` function which has been rewritten using the provided Python functions. The `matrix_vec_mul` function is used to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nThis Python function behaves in the same way as the C++ version. It takes two inputs: the 2D list `weight` and the 1D list `input`. It returns a 1D list as output, which is the result of multiplying `weight` and `input`.",
    "The given C++ function is a matrix multiplication and it can be translated using the function `matrix_vec_mul`.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n```\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```",
    "The C++ function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef matmul(weight, input):\n    return matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)\n```\n\nIn the C++ 'test' function, a matrix multiplication is performed between a 'weight' matrix and an 'input' vector. The same operation is conducted by the 'matrix_vec_mul' function in Python. Hence, we can directly use this 'matrix_vec_mul' function to perform the required operation."
