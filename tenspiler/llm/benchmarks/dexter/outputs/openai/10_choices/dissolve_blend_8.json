    "Given that the \"test\" function you provided in C++ does pixel blending based on whether the opacity minus a random value is greater than or equal to 0, we can achieve the same logic using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    select_two_args_arg = (lambda b, a: a if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else b)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nIn the Python function:\n1. We use the same random value calculation as in the \"test\" function.\n2. We define a Python lambda function that does the same thing as the `if` condition in the \"test\" function.\n3. We then return the output of the `matrix_selection_two_args` function which applies our lambda function to each pair of corresponding items in two 2D arrays, just as the nested `for` loops do in the \"test\" function.",
    "This function is a dissolve blend function that blends two images together based on a given opacity and random constant. Here is the translated code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Callable\nimport random\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_const: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    rand_val = ((rand_const % 100) + 1) / 100\n    select_args = lambda x, y: y if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_args)\n```\n\nThe function `matrix_selection_two_args` takes two matrices and a selection function as input, and applies the selection function to each corresponding pair of elements from the two matrices. We define the selection function (`select_args`) to select an element from the `active` matrix if `opacity - rand_val` is greater than or equal to 0, or from the `base` matrix otherwise. The `rand_val` is calculated just as it is in the original C++ function.",
    "The test function `dissolve_blend_8` in C++ can be rewritten in the predefined Python functions as:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base, \n        active, \n        lambda x, y: y if (opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100) >= 0 else x\n    )\n```\nThis Python function uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to perform the operation for each pair of elements from the input matrices `base` and `active`. The `lambda` function inside decides which element to select based on the comparison between `opacity` and the normalized `rand_cons`. If the `opacity` is greater or equal to the normalized `rand_cons`, it selects the active color, otherwise, it selects the base color. This matches the logic of the original C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the test function using the provided helper functions and guidelines. This Python function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to evaluate each pixel in two input matrices and insert the corresponding pixel into the output list. The `select_two_args` function is defined to carry out the logic of comparing the opacity and a derived random value, and select the pixel from either the base or active matrix.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable, List\n\n# Helper function to perform equivalent 'rand%' operation\ndef remainder(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a % b\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    # Define the two-argument function for pixel selection\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel: int, active_pixel: int) -> int:\n        # Calculate the equivalent 'rand_val' using remainder() from the provided helper functions\n        rand_val = remainder(rand_cons, 100) + 1\n        # Select and return the pixel value based on the calculated 'rand_val'\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    \n    # Return the resultant blended matrix using the two-argument selection function on the base and active matrices\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nNote:\n- C++ and Python handle integer division differently. The expression 'rand_cons % 100' calculates the modulus of 'rand_cons' divided by 100. In C++, integer division results in truncation towards zero, whereas in Python, integer division results in a float. We use the provided remainder() function here to ensure identical functionality.\n- Because Python lacks a 'rand()' function equivalent to the one in C++, it is replaced here with the equivalent operation (rand_cons % 100) + 1.\n  \nAlso note that, unlike the original C++ function, the Python version directly returns the resultant matrix instead of populating an 'out' matrix variable.\n",
    "Here is the equivalent Python implementation using the given set of provided functions. In this case, we can use the matrix_selection_two_args function as a main method to replace the nested loops and conditions in the original C++ code.\n```\nfrom typing import Callable\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    def blend_pixel(base_pixel: int, active_pixel: int) -> int:\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend_pixel)\n```\nFor this solution to work, note that the values of the `opacity` and `rand_cons` variables have to be accessible inside the `blend_pixel()` function. For instance, we can achieve this by either passing them as global variables or as additional parameters to the function. However, given the closure property of Python functions, the above function can directly access `opacity` and `rand_cons` variables from the enclosing function `dissolve_blend_8`.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the provided functions can be written as:\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: active_pixel\n        if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100 >= 0\n        else base_pixel\n    )\n```\nHere, we use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function which applies a lambda function taking the base pixel and active pixel as arguments and then selecting the active pixel if the condition `opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100 >= 0` holds true; otherwise, the base pixel is chosen.\nThe lambda function basically serves to encapsulate and perform the pixel selection operation that is done in the C++ `if-else` block in the `test` function.",
    "The provided `dissolve_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using provided functions. The function can be in-lined using recursion rather than loops. In the original function, the purpose is blending two images (`base` and `active`), where the blend depends on the `opacity` and some random constant (`rand_cons`). Each pixel in the resulting image is chosen from either the `base` or `active` image based on whether a normalized version of `rand_cons` is smaller than `opacity` or not. This behavior can be mimicked in Python using your provided functions and lambda functions.\n\nBelow is the Python equivalent of your C++ function:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda x, y: \n            selection_two_args(\n                [x, y], \n                [0, 1], \n                lambda a, b: b if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0 else a\n            )\n    )\n```\n\nThis function uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to select either `x` (a pixel from the base image) or `y` (a pixel from the active image) for each pixel in the resulting image. The selection depends on the comparison of `opacity` and a normalized version of `rand_cons`, similar to your original function in C++. Note that due to possible float number precision, the result might not be exactly the same as in C++.",
    "Here's a Python script that does exactly what the `dissolve_blend_8` function does in C++, but without using explicit loops. Instead, it uses the provided list comprehension and other functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable, List\nimport math\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n\n    select_pixel: Callable[[int, int], int] = lambda base_pix, active_pix: active_pix if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pix\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nHere, we use the 'matrix_selection_two_args' function which applies `select_pixel` operation on each pair of corresponding elements in base and active images. The `select_pixel` function uses the opacity and randomly generated value to decide whether to select the pixel from the base image or the active image.",
    "The following Python function is semantically equivalent to your provided C++ function.  Note that `random()%100 + 1` in C++ will generate a random integer between 1 to 100 (inclusive) which is not equivalent to the python's `random.randint(1,100)/100` that would generate a float number between 0.01 to 1.00 (inclusive). That's why I replace it with `rand_cons % 100` since we intend to directly translate the code without modifying behaviours.\n\nRewritten function in Python:\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_cons: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda b, a: a if opacity - (rand_cons % 100) >= 0 else b\n    )\n```",
    "The function `dissolve_blend_8` can be improved upon by using the defined functions.\n\nYour task says that the rewritten program should just be a single return statement, however there are several steps in the `dissolve_blend_8` function that might need to be broken down to make the function easier to understand and read. \n\nHere is the rewritten function `dissolve_blend_8` in Python, following your instruction.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: active_pixel if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0 else base_pixel\n    )\n```\n\nThis function goes over the two matrices `base` and `active` and for each corresponding pair of elements, it applies a function that checks if opacity is greater than the randomly generated value `rand_val`. If that's true, it picks the active pixel, otherwise it picks the base pixel. This logic implements the same as the original given `C++` function."
