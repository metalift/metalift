In python, the function could look something like the provided code. The complexity would still be O(m*n), where m and n are the dimensions of the image, because each pixel needs to be inspected individually.",
    "The test function in Example 2 can be rewritten in terms of the provided functions as follows:\n\n```\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        active, \n        base, \n        lambda active_pixel, base_pixel: active_pixel if (opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100) >= 0 else base_pixel\n    )\n```\n\nPlease note that `matrix_selection_two_args` is a higher order function used to implement an element-wise operation on matrix elements depending on a condition. This is equivalent to the if-else branch inside the loop of the original `test` function in Example 2. The choice of using either active pixel or base pixel depends on whether opacity minus the random constant yields a non-negative value.",

Then, we calculated the condition matrix by subtracting `rand_val_vec` from opacity. This matrix is then passed to the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which checks each cell of the condition matrix; if the cell's value is greater than or equal to zero, it selects the corresponding cell from the active matrix, otherwise it selects the cell from the base matrix. This returns a matrix identical to `out` in the original function."
