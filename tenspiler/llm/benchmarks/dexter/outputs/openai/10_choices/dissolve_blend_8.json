    "You can rewrite the \"dissolve_blend_8\" C++ function in Python using the given set of predefined functions in Python as below:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    opacity_map = [[opacity] * len(base[0])] * len(base)\n    rand_cons_matrix = [[rand_cons % 100 + 1] * len(base[0])] * len(base)\n    matrix_div = matrix_scalar_div(100, rand_cons_matrix)\n    matrix_sub = matrix_elemwise_sub(opacity_map, matrix_div)\n    select_two_args_arg = (lambda x, y: active[base.index(x)][x.index(y)]\n                                      if x - y >= 0 else base[base.index(x)][x.index(y)])\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_sub, \n             [[0]*len(base[0])] * len(base), select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the C++ function. Here we generate a matrix for opacity and one for the rand_cons values. \n\nThen we subtract the division of rand_cons matrix by 100 from the opacity matrix.\n\nFinally, we use the custom function inside the matrix_selection_two_args to pick the pixel from the 'active' or 'base' matrix based on whether the value in the matrix_sub is greater or equal to zero.\n\nIn this function, we assumed that base, active are matrices (2 dimensional list) and opacity, rand_cons are integers. Each row in base, active matrixes are of equal length.",
    "Sure, here's a Python equivalent of the function in Python language using the given set of functions. I will use `matrix_selection_two_args` function, a custom function `calc_pixel` to perform your conditional statement and `opacity` and `rand_cons` as global variables as the given set of functions do not support passing extra argument.\n\n```python\n# define global variables\nopacity = 0\nrand_cons = 0\n\ndef calc_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    global opacity\n    global rand_cons\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n    return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active):\n    global opacity\n    global rand_cons\n    opacity = 50  # Replace with the required opacity value\n    rand_cons = 10  # Replace with the required random constant value\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, calc_pixel)\n```\nYou can change `opacity` and `rand_cons` as per the required opacity and random constant value. Python does not have the equivalent of C++'s `rand()` function that generates the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers each time the program runs. So, we are using a constant number just for simplicity- replace it as per your needs. \n\nThe function `dissolve_blend_8()` takes two matrices `base` and `active` as input and returns a blended matrix based on the condition from the C++ function in the question.",
    "Below is a Python-like script equivalent of the C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function using the provided Python functions.\n\nWe define a helper function `blend_pixel` which calculates the pixel value from either base or active based on the `rand_val` and `opacity`. We use `selection_two_args` to match the original behaviour of looping over `row` and `col`. In the helper function, we generate `rand_val` using `rand_cons`. Then we use the `selection_two_args` to decide whether to take the pixel from `active` or `base`.\n```\n# helper function\ndef blend_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    return active_pixel if (opacity - rand_val >= 0) else base_pixel\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base, active, lambda x, y: blend_pixel(x, y, opacity, rand_cons)\n    )\n```",
    "To rewrite the given `dissolve_blend_8` C++ function in Python, make use of the provided functions above. In this function, each pixel in the output image is selected from either the base layer or the active layer depending on a random value. The chosen pixel becomes the pixel of the active layer if the opacity exceeds the random value and the pixel of the base layer otherwise. Simple logic dictates that a higher opacity tends to result in more pixels from the active layer in the output image.\n\n```python\ndef test(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return active_pixel\n        else:\n            return base_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to iterate over the matrix/array elements and apply the `select_pixel` function to select the pixel to be used from either the base layer or the active layer. It effectively recreates the double nested loop used in the original C++ code. The select_pixel function is used as a selection function and replicates the if-else condition used in the original code.",
    "Here is the Python version of the `dissolve_blend_8` function using the provided helper functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n\n    def select_opac_based_pixel(a, b):\n        rand_val = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) // 100\n        return a if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else b\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_opac_based_pixel)\n``` \n\nThis Python function uses a helper function `select_opac_based_pixel` to determine which pixel to select based on the opacity and random value and then applies this to each corresponding pair of pixels in `active` and `base` matrices using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This will result in a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrices where each value is selected in the same way as in the original C++ function.",
    "Below is the equivalent function in Python using the provided higher-order functions and constants. This Python function implements the same logic as the C++ function by creating a pixel blending effect.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_two_args_arg(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return active_pixel\n        else:\n            return base_pixel\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThis `dissolve_blend_8` function in Python, as you see, takes four parameters (matrix `base`, matrix `active`, an integer `opacity` and another integer `rand_cons`) very similar to that of C++ function and it returns a matrix through applying a selection process depending on the opacity and a random value for each corresponding pair of pixels in the base and active matrices. This function essentially performs a dissolve blending operation for two given matrices.",
    "The Python equivalent of the given C++ function 'dissolve_blend_8' by using the functions and constants mentioned can be expressed as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\n\ndef generate_random_val(rand_cons): \n    return (rand_cons % 100 + 1) / 100\n\ndef choose_pixel(opacity, base_pixel, active_pixel, random_val):\n    return active_pixel if (opacity - random_val >= 0) else base_pixel\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base, \n        active, \n        lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: \\\n            choose_pixel(opacity, base_pixel, active_pixel, \\\n                     generate_random_val(rand_cons))\n    )\n```\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n- `generate_random_val` is a helper function that generates a random value between 0 and 1.\n- `choose_pixel` is another helper function that chooses the pixel value from `active` or `base` based on the opacity level and random value.\n- The main equivalent function `dissolve_blend_8` uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a given function - in this case, `choose_pixel` - to every pair of corresponding elements in two matrices `base` and `active`.\n\nThe output matrix of `dissolve_blend_8` has the same size as `base` and `active`. For each pixel, it chooses `base` or `active` based on the opacity level and random value. If `opacity - random_val` is greater than or equal to 0, it will choose the pixel from `active`, otherwise, it will choose it from `base`. This corresponds to the original C++ function's logic.",
    "Here is a Python function that is semantically equivalent to the given C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function. This Python function uses the provided functions and constants.\n\nThe `map_int_to_int` function is used as a callback in the `vec_map` and `matrix_selection_two_args` functions. It returns an integer based on the `opacity` and `rand_cons` values, comparing them with a random number.\n\nNote that the condition in the `map_int_to_int` function matches that of the C++ function where it checks if `opacity - rand_val >= 0`. If it is true, it returns the corresponding `active` pixel, otherwise it returns the base pixel.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    def map_int_to_int(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n\n    selection_two_args_func = functools.partial(selection_two_args, select_two_args_arg=map_int_to_int)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, selection_two_args_func)\n```",
    "Below is a Python version of your `dissolve_blend_8` C++ function using the defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    matrix_selection_function = lambda x, y: y if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0 else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, matrix_selection_function)\n``` \nIn this function, we are defining a `lambda` function which is an anonymous function that takes in two arguments, `x` and `y`. This function returns `y` if `opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0` else it returns `x`. We are then passing `base`, `active` and `matrix_selection_function` as arguments to the `matrix_selection_two_args` method. This approach achieves the same logic as the C++ function.\n\nPlease note that the exact parallels can't be achieved due to differences in strict typing and operation rules between the two languages.",
    "When you look at the C++ function `dissolve_blend_8()`, it essentially blends two 2D vectors (images) based on a random value and a predefined opacity. If the opacity minus the random value is greater than or equal to zero, it takes the pixel value from the active image, otherwise from the base image. To achieve this with the provided Python functions can be a bit tricky as you don't have direct access to a random value generator. However, you can simulate it through a function argument `rand_values` which should be a matrix of the same size with base and active images containing random values between 0 and 1.\n\nHere's how you might implement that:\n```python\ndef rand_condition(a, b, rand_val, opacity):\n  return a if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else b\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_values):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, rand_condition),\n        rand_values,\n        lambda a, rand_val: a if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base\n    )\n```\nIn the above code, we define a helper function `rand_condition()` which takes the parameters `a` and `b` (active pixel and base pixel respectively), `rand_val` (random value), and `opacity`. It returns `a` if `opacity - rand_val` is greater or equal to zero, else `b`.\n\nWe then define our main function `dissolve_blend_8()` which uses the helper function in combination with `matrix_selection_two_args()`. The `matrix_selection_two_args()` function is used twice. The first call selects the pixel depending on the random value and opacity. The result of this is then compared with `rand_values` again for the final output."
