    "The `linear_dodge_8` function in C++ adds the pixel values of two images represented by 2D vectors `base` and `active`. It does so by iterating over every pixel in both images and adding the corresponding pixels together. The result is stored in a new 2D vector `out` which is then returned. \n\nThe equivalent code in Python using the provided functions would be the `matrix_elemwise_add` function. This function takes two matrices as arguments and adds them together element-wise. The result is a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrices but with the values at each position being the sum of the values at the corresponding position in the input matrices. Here is how you can use it to implement the `linear_dodge_8` function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same thing as the C++ function: it adds two 2D lists (representing images) together pixel by pixel.",
    "You can rewrite the given C++ function using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function. Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis function does exactly the same thing as the C++ function: It adds the corresponding elements of the two input matrices. Note that the `matrix_elemwise_add` function checks that the sizes of the input matrices match. If the sizes don't match, it returns an empty matrix. If the sizes do match, it returns a new matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input matrices.",
    "The given C++ program performs an operation known as linear dodge, often used in image processing. It takes two 2D vectors or grids (which could represent images) and adds the corresponding elements (pixels) together. \n\nBy looking at the provided Python functions, the equivalent function that you should use in Python is `matrix_elemwise_add`. Here is the Python version of the given C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis Python function is equivalent to the given C++ function, taking two 2D lists (matrices) as inputs and returning their element-wise sum as a new 2D list. The `matrix_elemwise_add` Python function goes through both matrices row by row and column by column, adding the corresponding elements together, hence matching the logic of the given C++ function.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python function using the provided functions and constants. \n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nThis Python function takes two matrix arguments namely `base` and `active`. It then applies the `matrix_elemwise_add` function to these two matrix variables. This operation basically elements-wise addition operation on pairs of matrix elements. It is equivalent to your C++ function where you are adding elements from `base` and `active` matrices and storing in `out` matrix.",
    "The C++ function `linear_dodge_8` which effectively adds two 2D matrices element by element can be re-written in Python using the provided set of functions as:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nHere, `matrix_elemwise_add` is a predefined function that does exactly the same operation that `linear_dodge_8` does in C++. It adds two 2D matrices element by element."
