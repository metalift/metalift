    "The given C++ function `multiply_blend_8` performs element-wise multiplication of two matrices `base` and `active`, then divides each result by 255. The equivalent Python function using the provided functions is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    # perform element-wise multiplication of base and active\n    mult_result = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)\n\n    # create a function to map each element to its division by 255\n    div_by_255 = lambda x: x // 255\n\n    # apply this function to each element of mult_result\n    result = matrix_vec_map(mult_result, div_by_255)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nHowever, the function `matrix_vec_map` is not defined in the provided functions. It would be used to apply a function element-wise to a matrix. We would need to add the following function definition:\n\n```python\ndef matrix_vec_map(matrix_x, map_int_to_int):\n    return [] if len(matrix_x) < 1 else [vec_map(matrix_x[0], map_int_to_int), *matrix_vec_map(matrix_x[1:], map_int_to_int)]\n```\n\nAfter adding this function, the Python equivalent will work as expected. This assumes that the input matrices `base` and `active` are matrices of integers.",
    "The `multiply_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python by using `matrix_elemwise_mul` and `matrix_scalar_div` functions. The function `matrix_elemwise_mul` multiplies each corresponding element in `base` and `active` matrices. Then `matrix_scalar_div` function is used to divide each result by 255. Below is the Python equivalent function:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ version. The function multiplies corresponding elements in the two input matrices `base` and `active`, and then divide the resulting matrix by 255. The result is the equivalent pixel-wise multiplication and division by 255 that is done in the original C++ function. The only difference is that the Python version is vectorized and does not include for-loops.",
    "Here is the Python version of the provided C++ function using the defined operations:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Defining a function to scale the pixel values\n    def scale_pixel(x, y):\n        return (x * y) // 255\n    # Applying the scaling operation to every pixel in the matrices\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, scale_pixel)\n```\nHere `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to apply the same operation to every item in the two matrices. In each call, it passes two corresponding elements from the matrices to `scale_pixel`. `scale_pixel` calculates the new pixel value exactly as in the original `multiply_blend_8` function.\n\nThis function with semantics equivalent to the C++ function.",
    "The C++ function `multiply_blend_8` multiplies each entry in two 2D vectors (representing pixel values in an image) and divides them by 255. This can be rewritten using the supplied functions in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    # First perform element-wise multiplication of two matrices.\n    mul_result = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)\n\n    # Then perform scalar division on the resulting matrix.\n    # Here, we are dividing every entry by 255.\n    out = matrix_scalar_div(255, mul_result)\n\n    return out\n```\n\nThis function achieves the same functionality as the provided C++ function using the given set of Python functions. It first computes the element-wise multiplication of two input matrices then divides every entry of the result by 255.",
    "The `multiply_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the set of provided functions. The semantically equivalent code is as follow:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n\n    # Create a map function to apply \n    def map_int_to_int(value):\n        return value // 255\n\n    # multiply matrices element-wise\n    multiplied_matrix = matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)\n    \n    # map elements using the above mapping function\n    return vec_map(multiplied_matrix, map_int_to_int)\n```\n\nIn the above Python code, `matrix_elemwise_mul` function is equivalent to the multiplication `base[row][col] * active[row][col]` in C++ code. Then we use `vec_map` function to divide the results by 255 for each value in the matrix which is equivalent to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` in C++ code."
