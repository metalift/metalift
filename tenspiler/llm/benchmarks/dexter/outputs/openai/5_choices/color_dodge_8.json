    "To rewrite the given `color_dodge_8` function using your defined Python functions, we need to closely follow the algorithm in the provided function. In this case, we're iterating over each pixel of two images (base and active), and performing color dodge operation as per the formula `pixel = base[row][col] / (255 - active[row][col])` if the active pixel is not 255, otherwise pixel remain 255.\n\nBelow is my effort to rewrite the function using your provided helper functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    def color_dodge_pixel(b, a):\n        return 255 if a == 255 else b // (255 - a)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_dodge_pixel)\n```\n\nThe function `color_dodge_pixel` is created to apply the logic of pixel calculation that is implemented in the given C++ function. We used the `matrix_selection_two_args` defined function to iterate over each pixel of the two images, and apply the color dodge operation as specified in the `color_dodge_pixel` function. This function is aiming to do the same task as the given C++ function.",
    "According to the provided C++ code, to perform the `color_dodge_8` operation on the pixel intensities of two images (represented by the matrices `base` and `active`), a new matrix `out` is calculated where each element corresponds to the application of the `color_dodge_8` formula.\n\nHere's how you can rewrite this program using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\n\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n\n    # Define a function that mimics the behavior of the if...else logic in your C++ function\n    def color_dodge_8_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 255 else base_pixel // (255 - active_pixel)\n\n    # Use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply `color_dodge_8_pixel` to every pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_dodge_8_pixel)\n\n```\n\nThe defined function `color_dodge_8_pixel` takes in a pair of corresponding pixels from `base` and `active` and applies the required operation as per the provided C++ function. `color_dodge_8_pixel` is then applied to each pair of corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function.\n\nThis Python function should provide the expected output equivalent to your provided C++ function. But please note that integer division in Python (using `//`) discards the fractional part, which may cause notable changes in results if pixel intensities are not integers. For accurate results with floating-point numbers, replace `//` with `/`. However, if your pixel intensities are indeed integers, then this code should work fine.\n",
    "Given the provided set of Python functions, our `color_dodge_8` mapped from the original C++ function is:\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n\n    def dodge_func(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 255 if active_pixel == 255 else base_pixel // (255 - active_pixel)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, dodge_func)\n```\nThis `color_dodge_8` function in Python does exactly what the C++ function does - it calculates the color dodge effect using provided base and active matrices. The helper function `dodge_func` implements the calculation for a pixel dodge effect, and is used as an argument for the `matrix_selection_two_args` which applies this function to every pair of corresponding elements in base and active matrices, thus maintaining the original function's behaviors (semantics).",
    "The C++ `color_dodge_8` function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n\n    def dodge(base, active):\n        if active == 255:\n            return 255\n        else:\n            return base // (255 - active)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, dodge)\n```\nHere's an explanation of the rewritten function.\n\n- The `color_dodge_8` function takes two arguments: base and active, which are both 2D arrays (matrices).\n- The `dodge` function is a local function that mimics the pixel calculation in the original function. It takes two arguments: base and active (which are now integers), verifies if the active value is 255, and if true, it returns 255. Otherwise, it performs and returns the calculation `base // (255 - active)`.\n- Finally, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used with base, active, and the local `dodge` function as arguments. This function applies the `dodge` function on each corresponding pair of elements in base and active (mimicking the pixel calculation within the nested for loop in the original function), and returns a new matrix with the calculated values.",
    "Your provided C++ `color_dodge_8` function is applying the color dodge blend mode per pixel of the given images. \n\nWe can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function along with a helper function called `color_dodge` to perform the same operation in python. Here is the equivalent python code using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge(base, active):\n        if active == 255:\n        \treturn 255\n        else:\n        \treturn base // (255 - active)\n\n\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n\treturn matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, color_dodge)\n```\n\nWe are doing the same thing, applying the color dodge blend operation pixel by pixel on two images. If the pixel value of the \"active\" image is 255, we return 255. Otherwise, we divide the pixel value of the \"base\" image by the result of subtracting the \"active\" image's pixel value from 255."
