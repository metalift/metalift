    "You can rewrite the provided `test` function in Python using the defined functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    \n    def pixel_select(active, base, opacity, rand):\n        rand_val = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) // 100\n        pixel = active if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base\n        return pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, pixel_select)\n```\n\nThis function maps over each pair of corresponding cells in the `base` and `active` matrices, and chooses a pixel based whether the calculated `rand_val` is less than the given `opacity`. This mimics the behavior of an if-else logic in the original request inside a nested loop.\n\n`matrix_selection_two_args` function is used here for iterating over all elements of `base` and `active` lists which are 2D lists. And `pixel_select` function is called for each element of these lists which is equivalent to the nested loop mentioned in the `test` function. The `pixel_select` functions provides equivalent semantics as the original C++ code. It selects a pixel based on the `opacity` and `rand_val` criteria, then returns the selected pixel value. \n\nPlease note, in Python integer division results the floor value not the percentage value like many other languages. So, this solution mimics the original C++ function bit by bit. If you want results in decimals you may want to use `/` operator instead of `//`.",
    "The function dissolve_blend_8 performs a blend operation on two given images (represented as 2D matrics). It uses the 'dissolve' method, which is a special effect used in motion graphics and visual effects. The active pixels from the active image are randomly replaced by the corresponding pixels in the base image based on a specified opacity. If the difference between the opacity and a random value is greater than or equal to zero, the pixel from the active image is used; otherwise, the pixel from the base image is selected. Given the constraints and functions available, the algorithm can be expressed in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) / 100\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nHere, we define a helper function select_pixel that takes two pixels (one from the base image and one from the active) and returns either of them based on the opacity and the random value. The outer function, dissolve_blend_8, uses this helper function with the matrix_selection_two_args function which applies select_pixel to corresponding pairs of pixel values from the base and active images.\n\nPlease note, the rand_cons parameter used in the dissolve_blend_8 function is assumed to create repeatable random values for testing purpose. For actual random values, replace rand_cons with a call to Python's random library: rand_val = random.randint(1, 100) / 100. This would generate a new random number each time.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python code using the provided functions.\n\n```python\ndef map_func(x): \n    return ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\nmapped_rand_val = vec_map([opacity], map_func) \n\ndef select_func(x, y): \n    return y if x - mapped_rand_val[0] >= 0 else x\nout = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_func)\n\nreturn out\n```\nThis code uses the given API to achieve the same result as the original C++ code. The notable difference is the use of high-order functions (`vec_map`, `matrix_selection_two_args`) and lambda expressions to capture the behavior of the blend operation.\n\nPlease note that this python code is dependent on the implementation of your `vec_map` function accepting a list as input but based on its definition in the provided functions, you should pass an integer instead of it. As a result, I suggest you revise the definition of the `vec_map` function.",
    "The `dissolve_blend_8` function works on two matrices `base` and `active`, of the same size. For each pixel (i.e. element of the matrix), if `opacity - rand_val` is greater than or equal to 0, it takes the corresponding pixel value from `active` matrix. If not, then it takes the pixel value from `base` matrix. In the end, it returns the new matrix it has formed.\n\nHere's the Python version of the `dissolve_blend_8` function using the provided defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):        \n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\nFor each pair of base and active pixel, the `select_pixel` function calculates `rand_val` and then chooses the pixel according to the `dissolve_blend_8` logic. We then use the defined function `matrix_selection_two_args` which applies `select_pixel` function to each pair of base and active pixel to create the new matrix. Note that we use integer division operator `//` in Python instead of the division operator `/` in C++ to get `rand_val` because in the original function the `opacity - rand_val` is compared with 0 which means `rand_val` must be an integer.\n",
    "The C++ function `dissolve_blend_8` is performing a dissolve blend operation on two 2D vectors (or matrices), `base` and `active`, according to an `opacity` value and a `random constant`, `rand_cons`. The given task is to rewrite the `dissolve_blend_8` function using only the aforementioned list of Python functions. \n\nUnfortunately, the above problem description has not provided an equivalent Python function for generating a random number, which is crucial to rewrite the given function. However, assuming there is a function called `rand_percent` that generates a random number between 1 and 100 (since the original `rand_val` in C++ code is a percentage), we can represent the C++ function with the available Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef rand_percent():\n    # Assume this function is available which returns a random percentage from 1 to 100.\n    pass\n\ndef map_func(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    rand_val = rand_percent()\n    if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n        return active_pixel\n    else:\n        return base_pixel\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, map_func)\n```\n\n`map_func()` is defined to model the operation inside the nested loops of the C++ code, which selects a pixel from either `active` or `base` depending upon the random value and `opacity`. `dissolve_blend_8()` applies this operation to every corresponding pair of pixels across `base` and `active` matrices using the `matrix_selection_two_args()` function.\n\nPlease note that this rewrite assumes that the Python list of functions includes a function for generating a random number, which is not present in the provided list. The lack of an equivalent random function in the given list makes it impossible to write a semantically equivalent Python function with the same behavior as the C++ function, as generating a random number is a key part of the C++ function's logic."
