    "Here's how the C++ `color_dodge_8` function could be rewritten in Python using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args_arg(a, b):\n        if b == 255:\n            return 255\n        else:\n            return a // (255 - b)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThis function uses the custom `matrix_selection_two_args` along with a dedicated function `select_two_args_arg` for element-wise operation. `select_two_args_arg` matches the pixel value calculation done inside the nested for loop of the original C++ function. The final result from `matrix_selection_two_args` would be identical with the original function, as it applies `select_two_args_arg` to the corresponding element pairs from the `base` and `active` lists."
