    "The test function `lighten_blend_8` in C++ can be translated to Python using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function from the pool of provided functions. The Python equivalent function can be:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same job as the C++ function. It takes two matrices `base` and `active` as input, iterates over each element in the matrices, and applies the `max` function to select the maximum value between corresponding elements from the two matrices (i.e., it makes a \"lighten blend\" operation in image processing context). \n\nThe result is another matrix that has the same dimensions as `base` and `active` and contains the maximum value for each corresponding pair of elements from the two matrices. This operation is equivalent to the decision-making process in the C++ function where it chooses the pixel from either `base` or `active` that has the maximum value."
