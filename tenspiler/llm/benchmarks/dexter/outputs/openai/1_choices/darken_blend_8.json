    "Here is how the given `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten in Python:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function performs element-wise operation on two matrices using the passed function to make a selection on each element. Here, `min` function is used to ensure that pixel-wise minimum is selected from `base` and `active`, matching the semantic of the original C++ function.\n\nPlease note that the Python `min` function is used in place of the conditional operator in the C++, for every pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. The `min` function returns the minimum of the two input parameters, which is semantically equivalent to the behavior of the if-else structure in the original C++ function."
