    "The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` is performing element-wise minimum operation between two 2D vectors `base` and `active`. It iterates over each row and column of the input 2D vectors, and for each corresponding pair of elements, it pushes the minimum value into a new 2D vector.\n\nHere is the Python equivalent using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nIn this Python version, we are using the function `matrix_selection_two_args` which iterates element-wise over the matrices `base` and `active` and applies the function `min` on each pair of corresponding elements, which is equivalent to the behavior of the original C++ function."
