    "Here's how to rewrite the `linear_dodge_8` function using the provided Python functions:\n \n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThis implementation maintains the same behavior as the original `linear_dodge_8` C++ function. The function `matrix_elemwise_add` takes two matrices (here represented as lists of lists) and returns a new matrix where the value at each position is the sum of the values at that position in the two input matrices. This is exactly what the `linear_dodge_8` function was doing."
