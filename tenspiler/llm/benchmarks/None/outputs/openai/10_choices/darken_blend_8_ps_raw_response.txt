The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` as input. It iterates over each element (pixel) of the matrices and selects the smaller value from the corresponding elements of `base` and `active`. The selected value is then added to the output matrix `out`.

We can achieve the same functionality using the predefined python functions by using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This function takes two matrices and a function that operates on two elements. It applies the given function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. We will use Python's built-in `min` function as the third argument to `matrix_selection_two_args`, which will select the smaller of two numbers.

The equivalent Python function is:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. It returns a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`.
Given the provided functions, the equivalent Python function for the C++ function `darken_blend_8` would look as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

Here, we use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function provided which applies a function (`min` in this case) to corresponding elements of two matrices. The Python built-in function `min` is equivalent to the if-else construct in the original C++ function, returning the smaller of the two input values. This achieves the same 'darken blend' effect as the original function.
Here's how you can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the provided functions:

```
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `min` as the selection function. This will effectively compare each pixel in the `base` and `active` matrices and select the smaller value, which is equivalent to the original C++ function.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be translated into Python using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which selects element-wise minimum from two matrices. Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base, active):
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function works by applying the `min` function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two input matrices, effectively replicating the behavior of the `darken_blend_8` function in C++.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ is essentially finding the minimum value for each corresponding element in two 2D arrays (or matrices). In other words, it's applying a "minimum" operation elementwise on the two input matrices.

We can implement this by using `matrix_selection_two_args` function. For the `select_two_args_arg` argument, we'll use a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns the minimum.

Here is the Python equivalent of `darken_blend_8` function:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: min(x, y))
```

This function will return a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. It is semantically equivalent to the `darken_blend_8` function in C++.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a function to each corresponding pair of elements in two matrices. The `min` function is used as the argument, which effectively darkens the blend by selecting the smaller of two corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices. This is equivalent to the logic in the C++ function.
The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors (matrices) `base` and `active` as input, iterates over each element and for each corresponding element in the two matrices, it selects the smaller value to add to the output matrix `out`.

This function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:
```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
The function `matrix_selection_two_args` applies the given function (in this case, `min`) to each corresponding pair of elements in the input matrices. This is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the `min` function to each corresponding pair of elements in the two matrices, `base` and `active`. This matches the behavior of the nested loop in the original C++ function, which selects the smaller of the two corresponding elements from `base` and `active` for each position in the output matrix.
The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. Here, we will use the `selection_two_args` function with the `min` function from Python's standard library as the `select_two_args_arg` parameter. This will return the minimum value between the elements at corresponding positions in the two input matrices, which is the equivalent of the conditional statement inside the nested loop of the original C++ function.

```python
from typing import List
import operator

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
Please note that the provided Python functions are written in a recursive style and may not be able to handle large inputs due to Python's recursion depth limit. For large inputs, it would be better to convert these functions to iterative style.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ blends two images (represented as 2D matrices) using a "darken" mode, where for each pixel, the smallest value between the base and active image is chosen.

We have to rewrite this function using the provided Python functions. The equivalent function can be written using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, with a lambda function that returns the minimum between two values. This directly corresponds to the behavior of the `darken_blend_8` function.

Here is the rewritten function:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: x if x < y else y)
```

This function will iterate over both matrices (base and active) and compare each corresponding pair of elements. It will select the smallest element and create a new matrix with these selected elements, which is exactly what the original `darken_blend_8` function does.
The `darken_blend_8` function is comparing each pixel in the `base` and `active` matrices, and appending the smaller value to the `out` matrix. This can be done using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, where the `select_two_args_arg` is a function that returns the minimum of two integers.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function iterates over each cell in the `base` and `active` matrices, applies the `min` function to the corresponding cells, and creates a new matrix with the results. This matches the logic of the `darken_blend_8` function in C++.
The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` applies the "darken" blend mode to two given 2D vectors (or matrices) `base` and `active`. This blend mode takes the smaller value of each corresponding pair of elements in the two input matrices.

This function can be converted into a single return statement using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a given function to each pair of corresponding elements in two input matrices. In this case we want to apply the `min` function, which will return the smaller value of the two inputs. This is the same operation performed in the original C++ function.
The function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` and returns a new 2D vector where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. It essentially applies the "darken blend mode" in image processing, where the darker color (lower value) is chosen for each pixel.

Here is how you can rewrite the function using the provided functions:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
The function `matrix_selection_two_args` applies a binary operation (in this case `min`) to corresponding elements of two matrices. It is equivalent to the nested for loop in the original function.
The function `darken_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base, active):
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

Explanation:
The function `darken_blend_8` takes two matrices `base` and `active` as input, and returns a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. This is exactly what the `matrix_selection_two_args` function does when the `select_two_args_arg` parameter is set to `min`. Therefore, the entire function can be replaced by a single call to `matrix_selection_two_args` with `min` as the third argument.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ compares each pixel in two 2D vectors (representing images) and chooses the darker one (the smaller value) for the output. It essentially implements a darken blend mode in image processing.

The equivalent function using the provided Python functions can be implemented as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with the `min` function as the selection function. It applies the `min` function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two input matrices, effectively choosing the smaller value for the output. This is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.
Based on the provided functions, the `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten in Python as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
This rewritten function takes two 2D lists (matrices), `base` and `active`, and applies the `min` function to each pair of corresponding elements from `base` and `active`. This operation is equivalent to the one performed in the original C++ function, where the minimum value of the base and active pixel values is selected for each position in the matrices.
The `darken_blend_8` function performs a pixel-wise comparison of two images (represented as 2D matrices), and selects the darker pixel at each position. This can be achieved using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function provided, with the selection function being `min`.

Here is the equivalent function using the provided functions:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the provided two-arg function (in this case, `min` which chooses the smaller of two values) to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. This is equivalent to the C++ function's behavior, which constructs a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the input matrices.
The C++ function `darken_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
The `matrix_selection_two_args` function will apply the `min` function to each pair of corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices, effectively replicating the behavior of the original C++ function.
The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ is applying the Darken Blend operation on two images (represented as 2D matrices). It chooses the smaller value from corresponding pixels of the base and active image.

The function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `min` as the selection function to select the smaller pixel value from the base and active images. This is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.
The C++ function `darken_blend_8` is a basic implementation of the 'Darken Blend Mode' in image processing. It takes two matrices `base` and `active` which represent the pixel intensities of two images. For each corresponding pair of pixels, it chooses the one with the lower intensity and puts it in the output matrix.

This function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
This Python function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a given binary function (in this case, `min`) element-wise on two matrices. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve, which is to select the darker pixel (i.e., the smaller value) from the corresponding positions in the two input matrices.
