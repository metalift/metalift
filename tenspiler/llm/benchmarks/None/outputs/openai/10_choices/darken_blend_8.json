    "The `darken_blend_8` function is comparing each pixel in the `base` and `active` matrices, and appending the smaller value to the `out` matrix. This can be done using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, where the `select_two_args_arg` is a function that returns the minimum of two integers. \n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each cell in the `base` and `active` matrices, applies the `min` function to the corresponding cells, and creates a new matrix with the results. This matches the logic of the `darken_blend_8` function in C++.",
    "The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` applies the \"darken\" blend mode to two given 2D vectors (or matrices) `base` and `active`. This blend mode takes the smaller value of each corresponding pair of elements in the two input matrices.\n\nThis function can be converted into a single return statement using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a given function to each pair of corresponding elements in two input matrices. In this case we want to apply the `min` function, which will return the smaller value of the two inputs. This is the same operation performed in the original C++ function.",
    "The function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` and returns a new 2D vector where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. It essentially applies the \"darken blend mode\" in image processing, where the darker color (lower value) is chosen for each pixel.\n\nHere is how you can rewrite the function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nThe function `matrix_selection_two_args` applies a binary operation (in this case `min`) to corresponding elements of two matrices. It is equivalent to the nested for loop in the original function.",
    "The function `darken_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `darken_blend_8` takes two matrices `base` and `active` as input, and returns a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. This is exactly what the `matrix_selection_two_args` function does when the `select_two_args_arg` parameter is set to `min`. Therefore, the entire function can be replaced by a single call to `matrix_selection_two_args` with `min` as the third argument.",
    "The `darken_blend_8` function in C++ compares each pixel in two 2D vectors (representing images) and chooses the darker one (the smaller value) for the output. It essentially implements a darken blend mode in image processing.\n\nThe equivalent function using the provided Python functions can be implemented as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with the `min` function as the selection function. It applies the `min` function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two input matrices, effectively choosing the smaller value for the output. This is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.",

This operation is equivalent to the one performed in the original C++ function, where the minimum value of the base and active pixel values is selected for each position in the matrices.",
    "The `darken_blend_8` function performs a pixel-wise comparison of two images (represented as 2D matrices), and selects the darker pixel at each position.

This is equivalent to the C++ function's behavior, which constructs a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the input matrices.",

    "The C++ function `darken_blend_8` is a basic implementation of the 'Darken Blend Mode' in image processing. It takes two matrices `base` and `active` which represent the pixel intensities of two images. For each corresponding pair of pixels, it chooses the one with the lower intensity and puts it in the output matrix.\n\nThis function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nThis Python function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a given binary function (in this case, `min`) element-wise on two matrices.
