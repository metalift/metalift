    "Here you go:\n\nRewritten function:\n```\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\nLoop invariant:\n\n```\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: List[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe loop invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration of a loop. Here, the invariant is that the sum of elements from the start of the list up to the current position is equal to the sum calculated so far. This condition is satisfied at the beginning of the loop (where sum is 0 and i is 0), and after every iteration, the sum is updated to include the next element of the list, thus maintaining the invariant.",
    "Rewritten Function:\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nLoop Invariant:\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: List[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe loop in the `softmax_part3` function iterates from 0 to `max_pos`, at each step it adds the element at index `i` in `output` to `sum`. Therefore, the loop invariant would be that for the current index `i`, `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `output` from index 0 to `i`. This is exactly what `reduce_sum(output[:i])` does.\n\nSo, the loop invariant `i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])` holds:\n- Initialization: Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `sum` is 0, which is equal to `reduce_sum(output[:0])`, so the invariant holds.\n- Maintenance: If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (for some `i`), at the end of the iteration `i` is incremented by 1 and `sum` is incremented by `output[i]`, which is equal to `reduce_sum(output[:i+1])`, so the invariant holds for the next iteration.\n- Termination: At termination, `i` equals `max_pos`, and `sum` is equal to `reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])`, which is the final result. Therefore, the loop correctly computes the sum of the first `max_pos` elements in `output`.\n  \nThis proves that the rewritten function is equivalent to the original one and correctly computes the result.",
    "The `softmax_part3` function can be rewritten using the defined function `reduce_sum` as follows:\n\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\nTo prove this function is equivalent to the `softmax_part3` function, you can write a loop invariant for the for loop in the `softmax_part3` function. The invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration. Here is the loop invariant:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: List[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\n\nThis invariant states that for any index `i` between `0` and `max_pos` (inclusive), the sum of the first `i` elements in the `output` list is equal to the `reduce_sum` of the first `i` elements in the `output` list. This is exactly what the `softmax_part3` function does, thus proving that the rewritten function is equivalent to the original one.",
    "Based on the defined functions and the given `softmax_part3` C++ function, we can rewrite this function using our defined functions in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nTo prove that this function is equivalent to the original `softmax_part3` function, we can use a loop invariant.\n\nThe loop invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration of a loop. It's used to prove that the loop does what it's supposed to do.\n\nHere's a loop invariant for the `softmax_part3` function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: List[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\n\nThis invariant states that at any point in the loop, `sum` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements in `output`. The invariant holds before the loop (when `i` is 0 and `sum` is 0), and it holds after each iteration of the loop (because each iteration increments `sum` by `output[i]` and increments `i` by 1). Therefore, we can conclude that the `softmax_part3` function correctly computes the sum of the first `max_pos` elements in `output`.",
    "The given `test` function in C++ can be rewritten using provided functions as:\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(output[:max_pos])\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers `output` and an integer `max_pos` as inputs and returns the sum of the elements in the `output` list up to the position `max_pos`. This is done by slicing the list up to `max_pos` and then using the provided `reduce_sum` function to sum up the elements in the sliced list.\n\nThe loop invariant for the original `test` function in C++ can be written as:\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: List[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\nThe loop invariant states that for any valid loop index `i` (0 <= `i` <= `max_pos`), the variable `sum` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements in the `output` list. This is consistent with the behavior of the loop in the original `test` function, which accumulates the sum of the elements in the `output` list up to the position `max_pos`.",

This is what the original loop in the `test` function is doing, so the invariant holds true before, during, and after the loop execution, which proves the correctness of the rewritten function.",
    "For rewriting the given `softmax_part3` function, we will use the provided function `reduce_sum` and `vec_slice`. The `reduce_sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all elements in a list, and `vec_slice` is used to slice a part of the list from the beginning to a certain position. \n\nThe rewritten function is as follows:\n```python\ndef softmax_part3(output: list[int], max_pos: int) -> int:\n    return reduce_sum(vec_slice(output, 0, max_pos))\n```\n\nNext, we need to provide the loop invariant for the given function. The loop invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration. It is used to show that a program or a piece of code does what it is supposed to do.\n\nThe loop in the function `softmax_part3` is calculating the sum of elements from index 0 to `max_pos - 1` in the output list. Therefore, the loop invariant is that the sum equals the sum of elements from index 0 to `i - 1` (where `i` is the loop variable) in the output list. We can write it as a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, max_pos: int, output: list[int], sum: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and sum == reduce_sum(vec_slice(output, 0, i))\n```\nIn this function, `i op expr()` represents the condition that `i` (the loop variable) is always between 0 and `max_pos`. The `sum == reduce_sum(vec_slice(output, 0, i))` part represents the condition that `sum` is always equal to the sum of elements from index 0 to `i - 1` in the output list. Thus, this function returns True if the conditions are satisfied, which means the loop invariant holds. Otherwise, it returns False.",
    "You can rewrite the 'softmax_part3' function using 'reduce_sum' and 'vec_slice' functions.

This is equivalent to slicing the `output` list from the start until `max_pos` and then reducing the sliced list by summing all its elements.\n\nThe loop invariant is stating that for any `i` (iteration variable) in the range [0, `max_pos`], the sum should be equal to the sum of all elements in `output` from the start until `i`. This is true before the loop starts (for `i=0` sum is 0), remains true after each iteration (each iteration adds `output[i]` to the sum), and when the loop terminates (when `i=max_pos`, sum is equal to the sum of all elements in `output` from start until `max_pos`). Thus, it's a valid loop invariant.",
