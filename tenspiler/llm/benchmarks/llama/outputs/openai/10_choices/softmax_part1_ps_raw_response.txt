The given `test` function in C++ is finding the maximum value in the input vector up to the position `max_pos`. The equivalent Python function using the provided set of functions can be written as:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return_var = reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, max_pos))
    return return_var
```
This Python function uses `reduce_max` to find the maximum value and `vec_slice` to slice the input list up to `max_pos`. The function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function.
The given C++ function `softmax_part1` can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return_var = reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, max_pos))
    return return_var
```
The given `softmax_part1` function in C++ can be rewritten as a single return statement in Python using the provided functions. The function `softmax_part1` calculates the maximum value in a list of integers up to a specified position.

In Python, using the provided functions, you can achieve the same result by slicing the input list up to `max_pos` and then applying the `reduce_max` function. Here is the rewritten function:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(input[:max_pos])
```

Please note that this Python function is 0-indexed, which means that if `max_pos` equals 5, elements from the first (index 0) to the fifth (index 4) will be considered, unlike in C++ where elements from the first to the fifth (index 5) would be considered. If you want to keep the same behavior as in C++, you should increase `max_pos` by 1 when calling this function.
The given C++ function `softmax_part1` takes a vector of integers and an integer position as input, then iterates through the vector up to the provided position, and returns the maximum value found.

To rewrite this function in Python using the provided functions, we can use the `reduce_max` function. This function takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value in the list. However, we need to give it a subset of the list from the start to the provided position. For this, we can use Python's list slicing.

Here is the rewritten function:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(input[:max_pos])
```
The given C++ function `softmax_part1` finds and returns the maximum value in the input vector up to a given position.

Here's the equivalent function using the provided Python functions:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(input[:max_pos])
```

The `reduce_max` function finds the maximum value in a list, which is equivalent to the given C++ function's operation. We slice the input list up to `max_pos` to match the function's behavior of only considering values up to `max_pos`.
Given the constraints from the provided functions and the original C++ function, the equivalent function in Python could be:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, max_pos))
```

In this function, we use `vec_slice` to create a sub-list from input, starting from index 0 to `max_pos` (exclusive), then `reduce_max` is used to find the maximum value in this sub-list, which is equivalent to the original function. It is assumed that `max_pos` is within the range of the `input` list size.
The test function in Python could be rewritten as:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(input[:max_pos])
```
This function takes a list of integers and a position as input, slices the list up to the given position and returns the maximum value in the sliced list. This is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function. The slicing of the list is done within the function call itself.
The given C++ function "softmax_part1" takes a vector of integers and an integer as input. It finds the maximum value in the vector upto the position "max_pos". Here is the Python equivalent of the function using the provided set of functions.

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(input[:max_pos])
```
This Python function also finds the maximum value in the list "input" upto the position "max_pos" just like the C++ function. It uses the provided function `reduce_max` which finds the maximum value in a list.
The given C++ function `softmax_part1` takes a vector of integers and a position as input. It then loops over the vector until the given position and returns the maximum value found in the vector up to the given position.

Since we aren't allowed to use loops in the rewritten function and we are not provided with a direct function to find the maximum value in a list, we can use the `reduce_max` function. This function takes a list and returns the maximum value in the list. But the function processes the entire list, so we need to slice the list to the required length first. We can achieve this using the `vec_slice` function.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, max_pos))
```
The given C++ function `softmax_part1` takes a vector of integers as input and a position `max_pos` till where it needs to find the maximum value in the vector. It then returns the maximum value found in the vector till the given position.

We can achieve the same functionality with the provided Python functions by using the `reduce_max` and `vec_slice` functions. The `reduce_max` function will give us the maximum value from a given list, and the `vec_slice` function will allow us to select the portion of the list till the `max_pos`.

Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function:

```python
def softmax_part1(input: List[int], max_pos: int) -> int:
    return reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, max_pos))
```

This function first slices the input list from the start to the `max_pos` and then finds the maximum value in the sliced list. The result is equivalent to the given C++ function.
