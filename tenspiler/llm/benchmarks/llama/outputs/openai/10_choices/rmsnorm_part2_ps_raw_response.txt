The C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` can be rewritten in Python as a single return statement using the given defined functions as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input), weight)
```

This function uses the following provided functions:

1. `vec_elemwise_mul(x: List[int], y: List[int])`: This function performs element-wise multiplication between two vectors.

2. `vec_scalar_mul(a: int, x: List[int])`: This function multiplies a scalar value with each element of a vector.

3. `integer_sqrt(n: int)`: This function calculates the integer square root of a given number.

The function `rmsnorm_part2` first calculates the inverse of the square root of `ss / size + 1` by using the `integer_sqrt` function. The resulting scalar is then multiplied with each element of the input vector by using `vec_scalar_mul`. Finally, element-wise multiplication is performed between the resulting vector and the weight vector using `vec_elemwise_mul`.
The given `rmsnorm_part2` C++ function performs element-wise multiplication between the input vector and weight vector, then multiplies each element by the inverse of the square root of `ss / size + 1`. Here's how it can be rewritten using the provided Python functions:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(input)
    inv_ss = scalar_vec_div(integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1), [1])[0]
    return vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight))
```

Here, `vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight)` performs the element-wise multiplication between `input` and `weight`. The result is then multiplied by `inv_ss` using `vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, ...)`. The inverse square root `inv_ss` is computed using `scalar_vec_div(integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1), [1])[0]`, where we divide 1 by the square root of `ss / size + 1`. We use `[1]` as the divisor vector to perform scalar division, and `[0]` to extract the result as a single number.
The `rmsnorm_part2` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(input)
    inv_ss = integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)
```

This Python function does the same thing as the C++ function. It first calculates `inv_ss` as the integer square root of `ss` divided by the size of the input plus 1. Then, it multiplies each element in the `input` list by `inv_ss` using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. Finally, it multiplies the resulting list element-wise with the `weight` list using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The result is a list of the same size as `input` and `weight`, where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `input` and `weight`, multiplied by `inv_ss`.
The C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` can be rewritten in Python as below:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input), weight)
```

The C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` takes as input two vectors (`input` and `weight`) and a scalar (`ss`). It calculates the size of the input vector, computes the inverse of the square root of the ratio of `ss` to the size of the input vector plus one, and then multiplies each element of the input vector with the corresponding element of the weight vector scaled by the computed inverse. The result is returned as a new vector.

We can achieve the same functionality using the provided functions as follows:
- Use `len(input)` to find the size of the input vector.
- Use `integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1)` to compute the inverse of the square root of the ratio of `ss` to the size of the input vector plus one.
- Use `vec_scalar_mul` to scale the elements of the input vector by the computed inverse.
- Use `vec_elemwise_mul` to multiply each element of the scaled input vector with the corresponding element of the weight vector.
- Return the resulting vector.
The given C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` takes a vector of integers as input and a weight vector, and an integer ss. It calculates the inverse of the square root of `ss/size+1` where size is the length of the input vector. Then, each element in the input vector is multiplied by the corresponding element in the weight vector and by the calculated inverse value. The result is returned as a vector of integers.

Considering the constraints and the provided functions, the `rmsnorm_part2` function can be rewritten in python as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input), weight)
```
This Python function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function. It first calculates the inverse of the square root of `ss/size+1` using the provided `integer_sqrt` function. Then, it multiplies each element in the input vector by this value using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. After that, it multiplies each element in the resulting vector by the corresponding element in the weight vector using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The resulting vector is returned.
The `rmsnorm_part2` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
from typing import List

def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt_helper(ss // len(input) + 1, 1), input), weight)
```
Here's what the rewritten function does:

1. It first calculates the size of the input vector and computes the inverse of the square root of `ss` divided by the size plus 1. This is done using the `integer_sqrt_helper` function.

2. Then it scales the input vector by this value using the `vec_scalar_mul` function.

3. Finally, it multiplies the scaled input vector element-wise with the weight vector using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function.

The rewritten function returns the same result as the original C++ function for the same input.
The provided C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` takes three arguments: two vectors `input` and `weight`, and an integer `ss`. The function calculates the inverse square root of `ss/size + 1` and multiplies it with each corresponding pair of elements from `input` and `weight` vectors. The resulting values are stored in a new `output` vector that the function returns.

You can rewrite the `rmsnorm_part2` function using the provided functions in Python as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt_helper(ss // len(input) + 1, 1), input), weight)
```

The helper function `integer_sqrt_helper` is used to calculate the inverse square root of `ss/size + 1`. This value is then multiplied with each element of the `input` vector using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. The resulting vector is then elementwise multiplied with the `weight` vector using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The resulting vector is directly returned from the function, making the function a single return statement as required.
Based on the provided functions and the given C++ code, you can rewrite the C++ function in Python as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(input)
    inv_ss = integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, input), weight)
```

In this Python function, we first calculate the size of the input list and compute the value of `inv_ss` using the provided `integer_sqrt` function. Then we multiply each element of the input list by `inv_ss` using `vec_scalar_mul` function. Finally, we multiply the resulting list element-wise with the weight list using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function.

This function should give the same result as the provided C++ function when called with the same arguments.
The provided C++ function `rmsnorm_part2` is essentially performing element-wise multiplication between the input vector and the weight vector. Each element in the result is scaled by `inv_ss` which is `(1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1))`.

To rewrite this function using the provided Python functions, we need to use `vec_elemwise_mul` for the element-wise multiplication, and then `vec_scalar_mul` to scale each element in the result. Since the Python functions use recursion instead of loops, we need not worry about index handling.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(input)
    inv_ss = integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)
    return vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight))
```

Please make sure to pass the correct arguments when calling this function. All arguments must be of the type `List[int]` for `input` and `weight`, and `int` for `ss`. The function will return a list of integers.
The `rmsnorm_part2` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def rmsnorm_part2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input), weight)
```

Explanation:
- `1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1)` is equivalent to `integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1)` in Python, because `//` operator gives the integer division in Python.
- `inv_ss * input[i] * weight[i]` is equivalent to `vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input), weight)`. Here, `vec_scalar_mul(integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1), input)` multiplies each element in `input` list with `integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1)`. Then `vec_elemwise_mul(..., weight)` multiplies each element in the previous resultant list with corresponding element in `weight` list.
