The given C++ function `transformer_part4` is taking two vectors as input, and a integer `hidden_dim`. It is generating an output vector by multiplying the elements of the two input vectors till the `hidden_dim` index.

The equivalent Python function using the provided function set is:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This function is using `vec_elemwise_mul` to multiply the corresponding elements of the two input vectors. It uses `vec_slice` to select elements from the input vectors till the `hidden_dim` index.
Based on the provided functions and the requirements, the given `test` function can be rewritten as shown below:

```
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

The `vec_slice` function is used to limit each input vector to the desired size (`hidden_dim`). Then, `vec_elemwise_mul` performs elementwise multiplication of the two vectors, which is equivalent to the multiplication operation in the for loop of the original C++ function.
The provided C++ function `transformer_part4` takes two vectors and a dimension size as input. It multiplies corresponding elements in both vectors up to the specified dimension size and returns the result as a new vector.

To rewrite this function using the provided Python functions, we can use the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. This function takes two lists as input and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input lists. However, before we can use this function, we need to slice the input lists up to `hidden_dim` using the `vec_slice` function to ensure that we only multiply the elements up to the specified dimension size.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function and uses only the provided Python functions and constants.
The `transformer_part4` function written in C++ takes two vectors and a dimension size as input. It multiplies corresponding elements in the input vectors up to the given dimension size and returns a new vector containing the results.

We can rewrite this function in Python using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function defined above and Python's own slicing feature. The `vec_elemwise_mul` function multiplies corresponding elements in two input vectors. We slice the input vectors up to `hidden_dim` to ensure we only operate on the required elements.

Here's the rewritten function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1[:hidden_dim], input2[:hidden_dim])
```

This Python function does exactly the same thing as the C++ function. It multiplies corresponding elements in the two input vectors up to the given dimension size and returns a new vector with the results. The slicing operation `[:hidden_dim]` in Python achieves the same effect as the for loop in the original C++ function, by operating only on the first `hidden_dim` elements of the input vectors.
The given C++ function `transformer_part4` takes two vectors `input1` and `input2`, and an integer `hidden_dim`. It creates a new vector `output` where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `input1` and `input2` up to `hidden_dim`.

To rewrite this function using the provided Python functions, we can use the `vec_elemwise_mul` function which multiplies corresponding elements from two input vectors. However, this function doesn't take into account the `hidden_dim` limit. To address this, we can use the `vec_slice` function to slice both input vectors from index 0 to `hidden_dim` before passing them to the `vec_elemwise_mul` function.

Here's the Python equivalent of the C++ function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This function definition is a single return statement as required and it doesn't use any intermediate variables. It's semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.
The given C++ function `transformer_part4` performs element-wise multiplication between two vectors `input1` and `input2`.

We can use the provided Python function `vec_elemwise_mul` to rewrite this C++ function. Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)
```

The function `transformer_part4` performs element-wise multiplication of `input1` and `input2` using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The `hidden_dim` parameter from the original C++ function is not needed in the Python function since the provided function `vec_elemwise_mul` automatically handles vectors of different lengths by ensuring they have the same length. If the vectors `input1` and `input2` do not have the same length, the function `vec_elemwise_mul` will return an empty list.
The equivalent Python function using the provided functions would be:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This function takes two lists of integers `input1` and `input2` and an integer `hidden_dim`. It slices the first `hidden_dim` elements from both `input1` and `input2` using the `vec_slice` function. Then, it returns the result of element-wise multiplication of the two sliced lists using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. This is equivalent to the original C++ function where each element in `output` is the product of the corresponding elements in `input1` and `input2`.
The provided C++ function `transformer_part4` takes two vectors, `input1` and `input2`, and an integer `hidden_dim`. It iterates over the range of `hidden_dim` and multiplies the corresponding elements of `input1` and `input2` to create a new vector `output`.

To rewrite this function using the provided Python functions, we can use the `vec_elemwise_mul` function which takes two lists and returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input lists. However, this function works on entire lists, so we need to slice `input1` and `input2` to the length of `hidden_dim` before applying the function. We can use the `vec_slice` function for this.

Here is the rewritten function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This Python function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function. It takes two lists and an integer as input, and returns a list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the sliced input lists.
The C++ function `transformer_part4` multiplies each corresponding element of two input vectors. In Python, using the functions provided, this can be achieved using `vec_elemwise_mul`.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)
```

This function takes two lists of integers as inputs and returns a list of integers. It multiplies each corresponding element of the two input lists. If the lengths of the lists are not equal, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input lists.
The given C++ function `transformer_part4` performs element-wise multiplication of two vectors `input1` and `input2` up to a given length `hidden_dim`.

This can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice(input2, 0, hidden_dim))
```

The `vec_slice` function is used to take a slice of each input vector from the start (`0`) to the `hidden_dim` index. Then the `vec_elemwise_mul` function is used to perform element-wise multiplication of the sliced input vectors.
