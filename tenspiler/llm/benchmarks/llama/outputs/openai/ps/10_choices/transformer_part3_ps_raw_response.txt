The equivalent Python function using the provided functions would look like this:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

This Python function uses the `vec_map` function to apply a lambda function to each element in the input list. The lambda function is equivalent to the operation performed inside the loop of the provided C++ function. It multiplies each element by the integer division of 1 and (1 + integer_exp(0 - element)).

Please note that Python uses // for integer division, while C++ uses / for integer division. Also note that slicing in Python is exclusive at the end, hence the use of `input[:hidden_dim]` which matches the C++ loop condition `i < hidden_dim`.
Given the constraints of not using loops and using the provided functions, the C++ function can be rewritten in Python as follows:

```python
from typing import List

def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

This function uses the provided `vec_map` function to apply the operation `x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))` on each element `x` of the `input` list up to `hidden_dim` index. The `integer_exp` function is used as it is directly mapping with `integer_exp` function in the original C++ program.

Please note that in the provided set of functions, the `integer_exp` function calculates the exponential of 3 raised to the power of `n` modulo 64. If you want to use the exponential with base `e` (approximately equals to 2.71828), you would need a different function that is not provided in the set of functions. The `integer_exp` function has been used here to match the function name in the original C++ program but it may not provide the expected results if you are expecting the base of the exponential to be `e`.

Also, the division operator in Python (`/`) returns a float, but the integer division operator (`//`) is used here to match the integer division in the C++ program.
The given C++ function `transformer_part3` performs element-wise multiplication of the input vector with the result of the expression `1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))`.

This can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_elemwise_mul(input[:hidden_dim],
                            vec_map(input[:hidden_dim],
                                    lambda x: 1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

In this Python version of the function, we are using the provided functions `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_map` to perform the same operations as in the C++ function.

The `vec_elemwise_mul` function performs element-wise multiplication of two vectors: `input[:hidden_dim]` and the result of `vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: 1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))`.

The `vec_map` function applies a lambda function `lambda x: 1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))` to each element of the vector `input[:hidden_dim]`. This lambda function is equivalent to the expression `1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))` in the C++ function.
The given C++ function `transformer_part3` can be rewritten as a Python function using the provided functions and constants. It computes an output list where each element is the product of the corresponding input element and the inverse of one plus the exponential of the negative of the input element.

Here is the Python equivalent using only the provided functions:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim), lambda x: vec_scalar_mul(x, scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, integer_exp(0 - x)))))
```

The `vec_map` function is used to apply a transformation to each element of the sliced input list. The transformation is a lambda function that multiplies the input element (`x`) with the inverse of one plus the exponential of the negative of the input element. This is achieved by using the `vec_scalar_mul`, `scalar_vec_div`, `vec_scalar_add` and `integer_exp` provided functions.
Based on the instructions, we need to rewrite the C++ `transformer_part3` function into a Python function using the provided functions. Please note that the `integer_exp` function in the original C++ function is not an exponential function, but simply returns the input value (x) back. Hence, it doesn't have any effect on the operation. The function is multiplying each element in the input vector with `(1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` which simplifies to `(1 / (1 + input[i]))` due to the `integer_exp` function. This can be achieved using the provided `vec_scalar_div` function in Python, which divides each element of a vector by a scalar value.

Here is the Python equivalent of the function using the provided functions:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_scalar_div(1, vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim))
```

This Python function uses `vec_slice` to extract the first `hidden_dim` elements from the `input` vector, and then `vec_scalar_div` to divide 1 by each of these elements. The result is a vector with the same length as `hidden_dim`, where each element is the reciprocal of the corresponding element in the `input` vector.
The given C++ function `transformer_part3` can be rewritten in Python using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

This function uses the `vec_map` function to apply a lambda function to each element of the `input` list. The lambda function multiplies each element by `1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))`, which is the same as the calculation performed in the C++ function.

Note that in the Python version, we use array slicing `input[:hidden_dim]` to mimic the loop in the C++ version, which runs from `0` to `hidden_dim`.
Based on the given C++ function and the provided Python functions, the Python equivalent of the C++ function can be re-written as a single return statement using the `vec_map` function. The `vec_map` function applies a function to each element of the input vector, which is exactly what the C++ function does.

The equivalent Python function is:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```
This Python function first slices the input list to only include the first `hidden_dim` elements using the slicing operator `[:]`. Then, it applies the lambda function `lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))` to each element of the sliced list. This lambda function performs the same calculation as the body of the for loop in the C++ function.

Note: The division in Python `//` is integer division, while in C++ `/` is floating-point division. If you need the division to be a floating-point division in Python, you can use the `/` operator. However, in this case, since the result is being stored in an integer, integer division is used to match the C++ function's behavior.
The given `test` C++ function can be rewritten in Python as follows:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

The provided function `vec_map` applies a function to each element of a vector. In this case, the function being applied is equivalent to the operation performed inside the original for loop in the C++ function. The function `integer_exp` is used to replace the `integer_exp` function from the C++ code. The slicing operation `input[:hidden_dim]` is used to limit the operation to the first `hidden_dim` elements of the `input` list, equivalent to the loop range in the original C++ function.
The equivalent Python function using only the provided functions would be:

```python
def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim),
                   lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```
Here, `vec_map` applies a function to each element in a vector, and `vec_slice` is used to slice the input vector from 0 to `hidden_dim`. The function applied in `vec_map` is equivalent to the one in the loop body of the original C++ function.
The provided `test` C++ function `transformer_part3` applies a transformation to each element of the input vector. The transformation includes multiplication of the element by the result of dividing 1 by the sum of 1 and the exponential of the negative of the element.

The function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
from typing import List

def transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:
    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))
```

The `vec_map` function applies a transformation to each element of the input vector. `input[:hidden_dim]` is used to limit the size of the input vector to `hidden_dim`. The transformation is defined as a lambda function that takes an element `x` and returns `x * (1 // (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))`.
