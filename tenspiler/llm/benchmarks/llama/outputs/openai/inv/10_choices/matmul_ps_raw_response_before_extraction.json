        "In order to create a loop invariant for each loop in the `matmul` function, we need to examine the operations done within the loop and how they affect the variables being used. The loop invariant should be a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's how we can define the loop invariant for the outer loop (involving the `row` variable) and the inner loop (involving the `col` variable):\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(row: int, col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row < len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nIn the `invariant1` function, we ensure that `row` is within the valid range, and that the `output` at any point is equal to the result of the `matrix_vec_mul` function for the rows processed so far.\n\nIn the `invariant2` function, we ensure that both `row` and `col` are within their respective valid ranges, and that `curr` is equal to the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the `weight` row and `input` columns processed so far.\n\nThese invariants hold true before and after each iteration of the respective loops, thus proving the assertion in the `matmul` function.",
        "For the given defined functions and the `matmul` test function, the two loop invariants would be:\n\n```\ndef invariant1(row: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `invariant1` checks the conditions before and after the first loop execution. It ensures that `row` is within the bounds of `weight` matrix and the output is equivalent to the result of multiplying the sliced `weight` matrix (up to the current row) with the `input` vector.\n\n2. `invariant2` checks the conditions before and after the second loop execution. It ensures that `col` is within the bounds of `input` vector and `curr` is equivalent to the sum of element-wise multiplication of the sliced row of `weight` matrix (up to the current column) and the sliced `input` vector (up to the current column). It essentially validates the result of the inner loop execution.",
        "Based on the given defined functions and the test function, the loop invariants can be written as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef invariant1(row: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nIn the `invariant1` function, the `row` is always between 0 and the number of rows in the weight matrix. The output at any point in time is the product of the current weight matrix (up to the current row) and input vector.\n\nIn the `invariant2` function, the `col` is always between 0 and the length of the input vector. The `curr` at any point in time is the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the current row of the weight matrix (up to the current column) and the corresponding elements of the input vector.",
        "Based on the provided functions and the test function, I can provide the loop invariants for the two loops in the matmul function.\n\nHere, the function `matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)` is equivalent to the operation performed by the nested loops in the test function (matmul function). \n\nFirstly, the inner loop calculates the dot product of a row in the weight matrix and the input vector. This is equivalent to the `reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row], input[:col+1]))` operation.\n\nSecondly, the outer loop performs this operation for each row in the weight matrix and appends the result to the output vector. This is equivalent to the `matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row+1], input)` operation.\n\nSo, we can define the invariants as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(row: int, col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row], input[:col]))\n```\n\nThese invariants state that at any point during the execution of the loops, the current values of output and curr are equal to the results of the corresponding operations on the first 'row' rows and first 'col' elements respectively.\n\nThe assertion `output == matrix_vec_mul(weight, input)` is true if these invariants hold for all iterations of the loops.",
        "For the given `matmul` function, we can define two loop invariants as requested. The outer loop invariant `invariant1` considers the row-wise multiplication and addition (matrix-vector multiplication) up to the current row. The inner loop invariant `invariant2` considers the element-wise multiplication and addition (dot product) up to the current column in the current row.\n\nHere are the Python definitions of these invariants:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef invariant1(curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output[:row] == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input) and curr == 0\n\ndef invariant2(col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row < len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nIn the `invariant1` function, `curr` is reset to `0` at the beginning of each outer loop iteration. Therefore, the invariant for `curr` is `curr == 0`.\n\nIn the `invariant2` function, `curr` should equal the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the `row`th row of `weight` and the input vector, up to the `col`th element. This is represented by `curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))`.\n\nNote that these invariants are based on the assumption that the functions `matrix_vec_mul`, `reduce_sum`, and `vec_elemwise_mul` are correctly implemented and that the input to the `matmul` function is well-formed, i.e., `weight` is a list of lists where each inner list has the same length as `input`.",
        "To prove the assertion, we need to identify the loop invariants for both loops in the `matmul` function. \n\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant is that `row` is between 0 and `m`, and `output` is equivalent to the result of multiplying the `weight` matrix sliced up to the current `row` with the `input` vector. This can be formulated as a Python boolean formula as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n```\n\nFor the inner loop, the loop invariant is that `col` is between 0 and `n`, `row` is less than `m`, and `curr` is equivalent to the result of multiplying the `weight` row vector at the current `row` sliced up to the current `col` with the corresponding slice of the `input` vector. This can be formulated as a Python boolean formula as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant2(col: int, curr: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int, weight: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row < len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nThese invariants hold at the start of each loop iteration and are maintained throughout the loop execution. Thus, they prove the correctness of the implementation and the assertion."
