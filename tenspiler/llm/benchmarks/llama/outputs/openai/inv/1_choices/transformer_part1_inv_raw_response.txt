Given the defined functions and the `transformer_part1` function, the loop invariants can be defined as follow:

```
def invariant1(token_position, head, head_size, key_cache_layer, q, attention, timestep):
    return timestep >= 0 and timestep <= token_position and attention == vec_scalar_div(integer_sqrt(head_size * 1), matrix_vec_mul(matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(key_cache_layer, 0, timestep), head * head_size, head * head_size + head_size), vec_slice(q, head * head_size, head * head_size + head_size)))

def invariant2(head, head_size, i, key_cache_layer, q, score, timestep, token_position):
    return i >= 0 and i <= head_size and score == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(q, head * head_size, head * head_size + head_size), matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(key_cache_layer, timestep, timestep + 1), head * head_size, head * head_size + head_size))) / integer_sqrt(head_size * 1)
```

In the first invariant, we are checking that the timestep is within the valid range and that the attention computed in the program is the same as computed using the defined functions.

In the second invariant, we are checking that the index `i` is within the valid range and that the score computed in the program is the same as computed using the defined functions.
