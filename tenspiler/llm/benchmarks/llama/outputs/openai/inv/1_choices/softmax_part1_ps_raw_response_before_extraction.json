{"softmax_part1": ["The loop invariant for the given test function `softmax_part1` can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], max_pos: int, max_val: int) -> bool:\n    return i > 0 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given test function, the loop is iterating from `i = 1` to `max_pos`. At each iteration, it checks if the current element in the input list is greater than the `max_val`. If it is, `max_val` is updated to the current element. Therefore, at any point `i` in the loop, `max_val` should be equal to the maximum value in the sublist of the input list from `0` to `i`. This is exactly what the invariant is checking. It is confirming that `i` is within the valid range of the loop and that `max_val` is indeed the maximum value of the sublist from `0` to `i`."]}
