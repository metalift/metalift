The invariant states that the current row index `row` is within the valid range (`0` to `m`), and that the current output element `curr` is the sum of element-wise multiplication of the current row of the weight matrix and the input vector up to the current row index.\n- `invariant2` is for the inner loop that iterates over the columns of the weight matrix (or equivalently, the elements of the input vector). The invariant states that the current column index `col` is within the valid range (`0` to `n`), and that the current output element `curr` is the sum of element-wise multiplication of the current row of the weight matrix and the input vector up to the current column index.\n\nThese invariants hold true at the start of each iteration, and they ensure that the final output vector is equivalent to the result of the matrix-vector multiplication operation `matrix_vec_mul`.",
