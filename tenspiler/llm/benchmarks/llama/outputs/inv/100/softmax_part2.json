It ensures `i` is within the valid range [0, `max_pos`].\n\n2. `cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)`: This is the calculation that's being performed inside the loop in the `softmax_part2` function.\n\n3. `output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, list_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)`: This represents the state of the `output` list after `i` iterations. It's essentially a vectorized version of the operation performed on each element in the loop. The `vec_map` function applies `integer_exp` to each element of the list produced by `vec_scalar_sub(max_val, list_slice(input, 0, i))`, which subtracts `max_val` from the first `i` elements of `input`.\n\nThe invariant holds true before the loop starts (`i = 0`), and assuming it holds true for `i = k`, it will hold true for `i = k+1` because of the operations performed inside the loop.

    "Based on the provided code, the loop invariant for the function `softmax_part2` could be written as follows:\n\nFirst, we define the invariant function:\n\n```Python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, list_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x))\n```\n\nHere, the output is derived from applying the `integer_exp` function to each element of the list obtained by subtracting `max_val` from the current slice of the input list (from 0 to i).\n\nThe invariant function asserts that for any iteration i in the range from 0 to `max_pos`, the output list is equivalent to the result of the described operation. This means that the output list is always up-to-date with the transformations applied in the loop for the current range of input data.",
    "The loop invariant for the given function can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, list_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x))\n```\n\nHere, the invariant checks that the index `i` is within the valid range of 0 to `max_pos`. It also asserts the current state of `output` based on the operations performed inside the loop. The `output` is formed by mapping the `integer_exp` function over the result of subtracting `max_val` from each element of the slice of `input` from beginning to `i` (non-inclusive). The `vec_map` and `vec_scalar_sub` functions correspond to the operations performed inside the loop.",
    "Based on the given test function and the defined functions, the loop invariant is as follows:\n\n```\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, max_pos:int, max_val:int, cur:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val) and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, input[:i]), integer_exp)\n```\n\nIn the invariant, `i` is the loop variable that goes from `0` to `max_pos`. The `cur` variable is the current value computed at each iteration `i`, which is based on the `integer_exp` function applied to the subtraction of `max_val` from the `i`-th element of `input`. The `output` sequence is the list of these `cur` values computed up to the `i`-th iteration. It is obtained by applying `integer_exp` to the result of subtracting `max_val` from each element of the `input` sublist from the first element up to the `i`-th element (not included), which is achieved with the `vec_map` and `vec_scalar_sub` functions.",
