    "Given the defined functions and the test function `softmax_part3`, the loop invariant can be defined as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(output: List[int], sum: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(output) and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```\nExplanation:\nThis loop invariant is checking three conditions:\n\n1. `i >= 0`: This condition ensures that the index `i` is never less than 0, which is the minimum valid index for a list in Python.\n2. `i <= len(output)`: This condition ensures that the index `i` is never more than the length of the list `output`, which would be an out-of-bounds index.\n3. `sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])`: This condition checks that the value of `sum` at any point in the loop is equal to the sum of the elements in the sub-list from the start of `output` up to (but not including) index `i`. This sub-list is obtained by slicing `output` using `output[:i]`. The `reduce_sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the values in this sub-list.\n\nThe loop invariant holds before the loop starts (as the sum of an empty list is 0), during each iteration of the loop (as `sum` is incremented by `output[i]` in step with `i`), and after the loop ends (when `i` equals `max_pos`, the end of the sub-list). Therefore, it helps to prove that the assertion `sum == reduce_sum(list_slice(output, 0, max_pos))` is true."
