    "Given the complexity of the defined functions, it's a bit hard to provide an exact loop invariant without additional context. However, based on the given information, the loop invariant could be something like this:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(unnormalized_output: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos:int, sum:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_scalar_div(sum, list_slice(unnormalized_output, 0, i))\n```\n\nThis invariant states that for all `i` from `0` to `max_pos`, the `output` list at any given point in the loop is equal to the result of the `vec_scalar_div` function when applied to the sum and the slice of `unnormalized_output` from `0` to `i`. This maintains the logic of the loop in the test function, asserting that the output is correctly calculated for all `i` in the given range."
