    "The loop invariant for the provided code can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(token_position, head, head_size, timestep, i, key_cache_layer, attention, xb):\n    return timestep >= 0 and timestep <= token_position and \\\n           i >= 0 and i < head_size and \\\n           xb == matrix_vec_mul(matrix_transpose(matrix_col_slice(list_slice(key_cache_layer, timestep + 1), head * head_size, head * head_size + i + 1)), \n                               list_slice(attention, 0, timestep + 1))\n```\n\nThis invariant is a boolean formula that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop in the `transformer_part2` function. It states that the value of `xb` at any point in the loop is equal to the result of the `matrix_vec_mul` operation on the relevant slices of `key_cache_layer` and `attention`.\n\nNote: `list_slice` is assumed to be a function that returns a slice of the list from index 0 to the given index, similar to the built-in slicing operation in Python."
