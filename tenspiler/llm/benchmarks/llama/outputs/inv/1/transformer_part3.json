    "In the provided example, the `transformer_part3` function performs an element-wise operation on a given input vector. Specifically, for each element in the input vector, it computes the value of the element multiplied by the result of the function 1 / (1 + exp(-input[i])). This is equivalent to the element-wise multiplication of the input vector with the vector obtained by mapping the function 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) to each element of the input vector.\n\nTo form the loop invariant for the given function, we need to consider the state of the variables at any arbitrary iteration `i` of the loop. \n\nAt the `i`-th iteration of the loop, the `output` vector will contain `i` elements, each of which is the result of applying the transformation to the corresponding element in the `input` vector.\n\nThe loop invariant should reflect these state conditions. Here's a possible loop invariant for the given function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, hidden_dim: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(list_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, list_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x)))))\n```\n\nThis invariant checks that `i` is within the correct bounds, and that the `output` vector matches the result of applying the transformation to the first `i` elements of the `input` vector. If this invariant holds true for every iteration of the loop, then it guarantees that the loop correctly implements the desired transformation."
