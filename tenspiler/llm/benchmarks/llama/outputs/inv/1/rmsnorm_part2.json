    "In the provided example, the \"rmsnorm_part2\" function is looping through each element of the input vector and multiplying it with the corresponding element of the weight vector, then multiplying the result with the inverse of the square root of (ss / size + 1). The resulting values are then stored in the output vector.\n\nThe loop invariant here could be represented as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1)\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nHere's the explanation:\n- `i >= 0 and i <= len(input)` ensures that the loop index is within the valid range.\n- `output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))` checks if the output vector is correctly filled with the processed input and weight vectors up to the i-th element. \n\nThis invariant holds true before the loop starts (when i is 0, the output is an empty list), during each iteration (as each element is processed and added to the output list) and after the loop ends (when i equals the input list length, the output list is fully populated)."
