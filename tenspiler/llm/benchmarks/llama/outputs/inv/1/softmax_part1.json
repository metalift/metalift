    "Here's the invariant for your softmax_part1 function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_val: int, max_pos: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(input[:i])\n```\nThis invariant states that at the start of each iteration, `max_val` is equal to the maximum value in the subarray of `input` from index 0 to `i`. It also confirms that `i` is always between 0 and `max_pos` inclusive. \n\nAt the start of the first iteration (`i=0`), the `max_val` is equal to the first element of the `input`, and the invariant holds true. For each subsequent iteration, if the `i-th` element of `input` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated to this new maximum value, and the invariant holds true. After the last iteration (`i=max_pos`), `max_val` equals to the maximum value in the subarray of `input` from index 0 to `max_pos`, and the invariant still holds true.\n\nThus, the assertion `max_val == reduce_max(list_slice(input, 0, max_pos))` is proven to be correct as `max_val` is indeed the maximum value in the subarray of `input` from index 0 to `max_pos`."
