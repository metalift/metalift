The output is the result of the matrix-vector multiplication up to the current row.\n\nIn the second loop invariant, we check if the current column is within the bounds of the input vector and the current row is within the bounds of the weight matrix. The curr variable is the result of the element-wise multiplication and summation of the current row of the weight matrix and the portion of the input vector up to the current column."
