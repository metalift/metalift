    "Based on the provided function `rmsnorm_part2` and defined functions, the loop invariant can be defined as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nHere, the invariant is defined with the condition `i >= 0 and i <= len(input)` which ensures that the loop index `i` is within the valid range of the input list `input`. The output at any point in the loop is calculated by scaling the element-wise multiplication of the `input` and `weight` vectors by the inverse square root of `(ss // len(input)) + 1`. This output is compared with the actual `output` variable in the loop to form the loop invariant.\n\nThe invariant checks if the output generated by the loop till the current iteration `i` is equal to the expected output calculated using the defined functions. This invariant holds true before the start of the loop, during each iteration, and at the end of the loop, thereby proving the assertion.\n",
    "Based on the provided information, the loop invariant for the test function `rmsnorm_part2` would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int) -> bool:\n    inv_ss = 1 / integer_sqrt(ss / len(input) + 1)\n    return (\n        i >= 0\n        and i <= len(input)\n        and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n    )\n```\n\nThis invariant states that for every `i` from `0` to `len(input)`, the `output` vector is the result of element-wise multiplication of the input and weight vectors (up to the `i`th element), multiplied by the scalar `inv_ss`.",
    "The loop invariant for the function `rmsnorm_part2` would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input[:i])) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nThis invariant is true before the loop starts (base case) as both sides of the equation will be empty lists. It remains true after each iteration (induction step) as we are simply repeating the same operation for each element in `input` and `weight`. Also, it gives us the final result we are looking for after the loop ends (exit case). Thus, it's a valid loop invariant.",
    "Based on the provided test function and defined functions, the loop invariant can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int]):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // i) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nThis invariant is true before the loop starts (i=0), remains true after every iteration, and the assertion is a restatement of the invariant after the loop has finished executing.",
    "In this case, the loop invariant can be defined as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int, weight: List[int]) -> bool:\n    inv_ss = 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // len(input) + 1)\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\nIn the above loop invariant, we are ensuring:\n- `i` is within the valid index of the `input` list (i.e., 0 to length of the list)\n- The `output` at any given iteration `i` is equal to the result of multiplying the inverse of the square root of `ss` divided by the size of `input` plus 1 by the element-wise multiplication of the `input` and `weight` lists up to the `i`th index.\n\nThis loop invariant holds before the loop (as an initialization condition), during each iteration (as a maintenance condition), and after the loop (as a termination condition), thus proving the assertion.",
    "In the given example, the loop invariant would be:\n```\ndef invariant(i: int, input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)\n    return i >= 0 and i <= size and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\nExplanation:\nThis invariant checks that the index `i` is within the bounds of the `input` list (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `size`). The `output` list is checked for equality with the result of the `vec_scalar_mul` function, which multiplies a scalar value `inv_ss` with the result of the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The `vec_elemwise_mul` function performs element-wise multiplication of the `input` and `weight` lists up to the `i`th index. The scalar value `inv_ss` is computed as the integer division of 1 by the result of the `integer_sqrt` function which takes as argument the integer division of `ss` by `size` plus 1. This loop invariant essentially asserts that the `output` list matches the expected output of the `rmsnorm_part2` function at each iteration of the loop.",
    "Here's the loop invariant for your example:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int, i:int):\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1)\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nIn this invariant:\n- `i >= 0 and i <= len(input)` ensures that the loop index is within the valid range.\n- `output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))` checks that the output at each iteration is the expected result of the operation on the input and weight vectors up to the current index, scaled by the inverse of the square root of `ss / size + 1`.",
    "In this case, the loop invariant can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, i: int) -> bool:\n    return (\n        i >= 0 \n        and i <= len(input) \n        and output == vec_scalar_mul(\n            (1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input)) + 1)), \n            vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i])\n        )\n    )\n```\n\nThis invariant checks that:\n\n1. The iteration variable `i` is within the boundaries of the input list.\n2. The `output` at any iteration `i` is the result of element-wise multiplication of the input list (up to the `i`-th element) and the weight list (up to the `i`-th element), scaled by the inverse of the square root of the sum of squares (`ss`) divided by the size of the input list increased by one. This scaling factor is integer divided by one, effectively rounding down to the nearest integer.\n\nThis invariant captures the state of the `output` list after each iteration in the loop, ensuring the correctness of the `rmsnorm_part2` function.",
    "Loop invariant for the given test function can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], ss: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `i >= 0 and i <= len(input)`: This part of the invariant states that the loop index `i` is always within the bounds of the input list.\n\n2. `output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))`: This part of the invariant states that the 'output' at any point in the loop is the result of the function `vec_scalar_mul` applied to the scalar `(1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input)) + 1))` and the element-wise multiplication of the input and weight vectors up to the `i`-th index.\n\nThis invariant holds true before the loop starts (base case), and assuming it holds true for `i = k`, it will also hold true for `i = k + 1` (induction step), thus proving the correctness of the test function.",
    "In the given example, the loop invariant should be defined as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i, input, weight, output, ss):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // i) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nThis invariant is true before the loop starts (base case) as `i` is 0, and the output is an empty list which is equivalent to the right side of the boolean formula.\n\nThe invariant also remains true after each iteration (maintenance) because in each iteration the `i`th element of `input` and `weight` are multiplied and then multiplied by `inv_ss`, which is equivalent to the right side of the boolean formula.\n\nFinally, when the loop is finished (termination), `i` equals to the length of `input` and the `output` is equal to applying the function `vec_scalar_mul()` on the whole `input` and `weight`, which is the final expected result. Thus, the loop invariant holds and the assertion is true."
