    "Below are the invariants for the given example.\n\n```\ndef invariant1(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n\ndef invariant2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i < len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe `rmsnorm_part2` function computes a vector by multiplying each element in `input` vector with the corresponding element in `weight` vector and a scalar constant factor `(1 // integer_sqrt((ss // size) + 1))`. This scalar factor is independent of the loop variable `i` and remains constant throughout the loop.\n\nThe first invariant, `invariant1`, holds before the loop starts (when `i = 0`), where no elements have been processed, so the `output` list is empty.\n\nThe second invariant, `invariant2`, holds during the execution of the loop. At the `i-th` step, the first `i` elements in the `input` and `weight` vectors have been processed, and the corresponding elements in the `output` list have been computed. \n\nBoth invariants are stated as Python boolean formulas that should return `True` when the invariants hold. They can be used to reason about the correctness of the `rmsnorm_part2` function, and prove that the `assert` statement holds.",
    "Based on the provided defined functions and the given test function, a possible loop invariant for the `rmsnorm_part2` function could be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss:int, output: List[int], size:int, inv_ss:int, i:int) -> bool:\n    return (\n        i >= 0 and \n        i <= len(input) and \n        size == len(input) and \n        inv_ss == 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1) and \n        output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n    )\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `i >= 0` : The index `i` is always non-negative as it starts from 0 and increments.\n\n2. `i <= len(input)`: The index `i` is always less than or equal to the length of the input list as it iterates through the list.\n\n3. `size == len(input)`: The size of the input list remains constant throughout the function.\n\n4. `inv_ss == 1 // integer_sqrt(ss // size + 1)`: The `inv_ss` variable remains constant throughout the function.\n\n5. `output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))`: The output list after `i` iterations is equal to the result of multiplying `inv_ss` with the element-wise product of the first `i` elements of the input and weight lists. It mirrors the operation inside the loop.",
    "The loop invariant for the provided function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, size: int, inv_ss: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i])) and size == len(input) and inv_ss == 1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1)\n```\n\nThis invariant states that:\n1. The index `i` is always within the range of `0` and the length of the input list.\n2. The output is always equal to the result of the scalar multiplication of `inv_ss` and the element-wise multiplication of the `input` and `weight` lists up to the current index `i`.\n3. The `size` is always equal to the length of the input list.\n4. `inv_ss` is always equal to the integer division of `1` and the integer square root of the result of the integer division of `ss` and `size` plus `1`. \n\nThis invariant holds true before the loop starts (base case), during each iteration of the loop (maintenance), and at the end of the loop (termination), which validates the correctness of the loop according to the method of loop invariants.",
    "Based on the provided functions and test function, here are the corresponding invariants for the test function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input)) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n\ndef invariant2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int]):\n    return output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input)) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight))\n```\n\nThese loop invariants state that at any point in the loop (for `invariant1`) and at the end of the loop (for `invariant2`), the output is equivalent to the result of the `vec_scalar_mul` function applied to the integer division of 1 by the integer square root of the integer division of `ss` by the length of the input plus 1, and the result of the `vec_elemwise_mul` function applied to the input and the weight vectors. For `invariant1`, this is applied to the slice of the input and weight vectors from the start to the current index `i`, and for `invariant2`, this is applied to the entire input and weight vectors.",
    "Based on the provided information, the task is to generate loop invariants for the given test function `rmsnorm_part2`. Here is the loop invariant for the function:\n\n```\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input[:i])) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis invariant is stating that for any `i` (where `i` is the current index in the loop), `output` is equivalent to the operation `vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input[:i])) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))`. It means that at each iteration of the loop, the current `output` is the result of multiplying the scaled version of the input (up to the current index) with the corresponding weights. This invariant holds true for each iteration of the loop and proves the correctness of the loop in the `rmsnorm_part2` function.\n\nPlease note that the code above assumes you have the functions `vec_scalar_mul`, `integer_sqrt`, `vec_elemwise_mul` and `len` defined in your scope. Also, the types List and int are assumed to be imported from the typing module.",
    "Based on the provided code, the invariants for the loops in the function `rmsnorm_part2` can be defined as follows:\n\n```\ndef invariant1(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt((ss // len(input[:i])) + 1)), vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n``` \n\nThis invariant states that for the current index `i`, the output is the result of multiplying the input element by the corresponding weight element and a scalar determined by the `ss` variable and the length of the input, using the defined functions `vec_scalar_mul`, `integer_sqrt` and `vec_elemwise_mul`. The invariant holds for `i` ranging from `0` to the length of the input list.",
    "Based on your provided test function, we can derive the loop invariant as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int) -> bool:\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul((1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))), input[:i]), weight[:i])\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe loop invariant function `invariant` takes the inputs of the function, the output list, and the current loop iterator `i` as arguments. It checks the following conditions:\n\n1. The loop iterator `i` is within the valid range (0 to length of the input list).\n\n2. The output list is equal to the result of the `vec_elemwise_mul` function applied to the result of `vec_scalar_mul` function (with the scalar being `1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))`) on the slice of the input list up to `i` and the slice of the weight list up to `i`.\n\nThis invariant holds at the start of the loop (when `i` is 0, the output list is empty, which is equivalent to applying the functions to empty slices of the input and weight lists), during the loop (the output list is updated in each loop iteration to include the calculation for the current `i`), and at the end of the loop (when `i` is equal to the length of the input list, the output list contains the calculation for all elements of the input and weight lists).\n\nThis loop invariant can help to prove the correctness of the `rmsnorm_part2` function. It shows that the function correctly calculates the element-wise multiplication of the input and weight lists, each element of the result being multiplied by `1 // integer_sqrt(((ss // len(input)) + 1))`.",
    "Based on the provided information, the invariants for the 'rmsnorm_part2' function could be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], size: int, inv_ss: int, i: int) -> bool:\n    return (i >= 0 and \n            i <= size and \n            output[:i] == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i])))\n\ndef invariant2(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], size: int, inv_ss: int) -> bool:\n    return output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input, weight))\n```\n\nIn the first invariant, we are checking the property for every iteration of the loop where 'i' is the loop variable. The property being checked is that the first 'i' elements of the output are equal to the first 'i' elements of the 'input' and 'weight' lists multiplied element-wise and then each element multiplied by 'inv_ss'.\n\nThe second invariant checks the same property but for the entire lists after the loop has finished executing. This makes sure that the entire 'output' list is equal to the 'input' and 'weight' lists multiplied element-wise and then each element multiplied by 'inv_ss'.",
    "In the given example, we have a single for loop that iterates over all elements in the input and weight vectors, scales each element of the input vector by the corresponding element in the weight vector, and then scales the result by the inverse square root of a specific value (ss divided by the size of input vector plus 1). The resulting values are stored in the output vector. Here's how we can define the loop invariant:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss: int, output: List[int], i: int) -> bool:\n    size = len(input)\n    inv_ss = 1 / integer_sqrt(ss / size + 1)\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\nIn this case, `input[:i]` and `weight[:i]` represent the portions of the input and weight vectors that have been processed up to the i-th iteration. The right side of the equation replicates the computation performed inside the loop for these processed portions. \n\nThis loop invariant holds true before the loop starts (i.e., when i = 0, the output will be an empty vector, which matches with the right-hand side computation as no elements have been processed yet), during each iteration of the loop (as each iteration correctly computes the result for the next element and adds it to the output vector), and after the loop ends (when all elements have been processed and the output vector contains the final result).",
    "Based on the provided definitions and the test function, the loop invariant could be written as:\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], weight: List[int], ss:int, output: List[int], i:int, size:int, inv_ss:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and output == vec_scalar_mul(inv_ss, vec_elemwise_mul(input[:i], weight[:i]))\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe invariant checks that the index `i` is within valid range of `0` to `len(input)`. It also checks if the `output` is equivalent to the operation defined within the loop of the test function i.e. multiplication of `inv_ss` with element wise multiplication of `input` and `weight` till index `i`.\n\nThe `output` is being calculated by operating on slices of `input` and `weight` from `0` to `i`. Since the loop in the test function operates on one element of `input` and `weight` at a time, slicing till `i` ensures we are considering all elements that have been operated upon till the current iteration of the loop. The invariant will hold true before and after every iteration of the loop. Thus, it is a valid loop invariant."
