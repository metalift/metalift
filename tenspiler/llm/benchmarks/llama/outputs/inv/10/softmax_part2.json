    "The invariant for the given function `softmax_part2` would look as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The loop is iterating over the range from `0` to `max_pos`. Therefore, `i` should always be greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `max_pos`.\n- After each iteration, for each `i`, we are computing `integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)` and appending it to `output`.\n- Therefore, the `output` at any point in the loop should be equivalent to mapping the `integer_exp` function over the slice of `input` from `0` to `i`, after subtracting `max_val` from each element. For this, we use the defined functions `vec_map`, `vec_scalar_sub`, and `integer_exp`.",
    "For the above function, the loop invariant would be as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```",
    "Based on the defined functions and the provided test function, the loop invariant can be expressed as follows:\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_pos: int, max_val: int, output: List[int], cur: int, i: int):\n    return (\n        i >= 0 \n        and i <= max_pos \n        and cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val) \n        and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n    )\n```\nThis invariant asserts that at each iteration of the loop in the `softmax_part2` function, the current value `cur` is the result of applying the `integer_exp` function to the difference between the input at the current index and the maximum value. Furthermore, the output up to the current iteration is equivalent to applying the `integer_exp` function to each value in the slice of the input from the start to the current index, after subtracting the maximum value from each value in the slice.",
    "For the given problem, the invariant can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], cur: int, i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int, output: List[int]):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val) and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `i >= 0 and i <= max_pos`: This asserts that the loop variable `i` is within the correct range.\n2. `cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)`: This asserts that the current value `cur` is calculated correctly with respect to the current index `i`.\n3. `output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)`: This asserts that the `output` vector is correctly calculated after `i` iterations. The output for each `i` is the exponential of the difference between the maximum value and the input at the current index. This is calculated for all input entries from index `0` to `i-1` (as indicated by `vec_slice(input, 0, i)`). The `vec_map` function applies the `integer_exp` function to each element of the sliced input vector.",
    "The invariant for the given program would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, max_pos: int, max_val: int, cur: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i < max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x)) and cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `i >= 0 and i < max_pos` ensures that the index `i` is within the valid range for the loop.\n- `output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x))` ensures that the output vector at the `i`th iteration is equivalent to the mapped and subtracted vector from the start of the input to the `i`th index. The mapping function is the exponential function.\n- `cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)` ensures that the calculation of `cur` in the loop iteration is equivalent to the exponential of the difference between the `i`th input and `max_val`.",
    "Based on the provided information and the defined functions, the loop invariant for the second example could be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i:int, max_val:int, max_pos:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the loop of the `softmax_part2` function, we are iterating over the range of max_pos. Therefore, our invariant should ensure that `i` is always within the range of [0, max_pos]. \n\nSecondly, in each iteration, the `cur` variable is calculated as `integer_exp(input[i] - max_val)`, and then it's added to the output list. Therefore, our invariant should ensure that the output list is always equivalent to the list obtained by mapping `integer_exp` function over the elements of the input list sliced from 0 to `i` and subtracted by `max_val`. This is achieved by the function call `vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)`.\n\nSo, if this invariant holds before and after every iteration, and it leads to our desired post condition, then it's a correct loop invariant.",
    "Based on the provided function `softmax_part2`, the loop invariant for the function can be defined as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The invariant condition checks that `i` is always between 0 and `max_pos` (inclusive), which ensures that we are within the boundaries of the input list.\n- The second part of the invariant asserts that the `output` list at any point in the loop is equal to the result of mapping the function `integer_exp` over the slice of the `input` list from the start to the current index `i` after subtracting `max_val`. This mirrors the operations performed inside the loop.",
    "Based on your provided test function `softmax_part2` and given defined functions, the loop invariant can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nThis loop invariant checks the following conditions:\n1. The loop counter `i` is within the valid index range of the input list.\n2. The `output` list at any point `i` in the loop is equivalent to applying the `integer_exp` function to every element in the `input` list from the start up to the `i-th` element, after subtracting `max_val` from each of the elements. This essentially mirrors the operations being performed inside the loop in the `softmax_part2` test function. \n\nThis ensures the correctness of the `softmax_part2` function as it guarantees that at any point during the iteration, the `output` list accurately represents the expected output based on the operations defined within the loop.",
    "Based on your instructions and given code, here is the loop invariant for the provided function:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_pos: int, max_val: int, output: List[int], cur: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and cur == integer_exp(input[i] - max_val) and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nThis invariant:\n\n1. Asserts that `i` is within the valid bounds of the loop (0 inclusive to `max_pos` exclusive).\n2. Checks that `cur` is the result of applying the `integer_exp()` function on the `i`-th element of `input` subtracted from `max_val`.\n3. Verifies that `output` is the result of mapping the `integer_exp()` function over the result of subtracting `max_val` from every element in the slice of `input` from the start to `i`.\n\nThis invariant holds at the beginning of the loop (when `i` is 0), and if it holds for an arbitrary loop iteration `i`, it also holds for the next iteration `i+1`. Therefore, it's an effective loop invariant that can be used to reason about the loop's correctness.",
    "Given the defined functions and the test function, the loop invariant for the softmax_part2 function would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], i: int, max_pos: int, max_val: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and output == vec_map(vec_scalar_sub(max_val, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)\n```\n\nThis invariant captures the following properties of the loop:\n- `i` is always within the bounds of the `input` list and `max_pos`.\n- The `output` list at any step `i` is equivalent to the vector map of the elementwise subtraction of `max_val` from the slice of `input` from 0 to `i`, where each element of the resulting vector is passed through the `integer_exp` function."
