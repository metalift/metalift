    "Based on your provided information, it appears that you are asking for a loop invariant for the given `matmul` function. The loop invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration.\n\nFirstly, the `matmul` function performs a matrix-vector multiplication, which is equivalent to the `matrix_vec_mul` function defined in Python. \n\nYou have two nested loops in the `matmul` function. The outer loop iterates over each row of the weight matrix and the inner loop performs the dot product of the current row of the weight matrix with the input vector. \n\nThe loop invariants for these loops can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int], output: List[int], row: int):\n    return (\n        row >= 0\n        and row <= len(weight)\n        and output == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[:row], input)) \n    )\n\ndef invariant2(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int], curr: int, row: int, col: int):\n    return (\n        col >= 0\n        and col <= len(input)\n        and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n    )\n```\n\nThe `invariant1` checks the condition after each iteration of the outer loop. It ensures that the `output` variable matches the result of the `matrix_vec_mul` operation on the portion of the weight matrix processed so far.\n\nThe `invariant2` checks the condition after each iteration of the inner loop. It ensures that the `curr` variable matches the result of the dot product operation on the portion of the current row and input vector processed so far.",
    "In this case, the loop invariants can be written as follows:\n\n```\ndef invariant1(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int], output: List[int], m: int, n:int, row: int):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= m and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int], curr: int, m: int, n:int, row: int, col: int):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= n and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. For the outer loop, the `invariant1` function states that for each `row` from `0` to `m`, the `output` is equivalent to the result of the matrix-vector multiplication of the `weight` matrix (up to the current `row`) and the `input` vector.\n\n2. For the inner loop, the `invariant2` function states that for each `col` from `0` to `n`, the `curr` (current sum) is equivalent to the result of the element-wise multiplication and sum of the `weight` row vector (up to the current `col`) and the `input` vector (up to the current `col`).

The outer loop iterates over each row of the weight matrix, and the inner loop performs a dot product between the current row of the weight matrix and the input vector. The `output` vector is built by appending the result of each dot product.\n\nThe first invariant `invariant1` ensures that at each iteration of the outer loop, the `output` vector matches the result of the matrix-vector multiplication up to the current row. This is achieved by slicing the weight matrix up to the current row and multiplying it with the input vector using the `matrix_vec_mul` function.\n\nThe second invariant `invariant2` ensures that at each iteration of the inner loop, the `curr` variable (which stores the result of the dot product) matches the result of the element-wise multiplication and sum of the current row of the weight matrix and the input vector up to the current column. This is achieved by slicing the current row of the weight matrix and the input vector up to the current column, performing element-wise multiplication using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function, and then summing the results using the `reduce_sum` function.",

The output is the result of the matrix-vector multiplication for the processed rows.\n\nIn `invariant2`, the column is between 0 and the number of elements in the input vector.
