    "Here are the loop invariants for the given example:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row, curr, input, output, weight):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row], input))\n\ndef invariant2(col, curr, input, output, row, weight):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row < len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor `invariant1`, the invariant condition is that the `row` index is within the bounds of the `weight` matrix, and the `output` vector is equivalent to the result of the matrix-vector multiplication of the `weight` matrix (up to the current row) and the `input` vector. The `curr` variable, which accumulates the dot products of the rows of the `weight` matrix and the `input` vector, is equivalent to the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the current row of the `weight` matrix and the `input` vector.\n\nFor `invariant2`, the invariant condition is that the `col` index is within the bounds of the `input` vector, and the `row` index is within the bounds of the `weight` matrix.

This invariant is maintained until the end of the inner loop. \n\nThese invariants help prove the assertion that `output` is equal to the matrix-vector multiplication of `weight` and `input` as they maintain the state of the output and current variables at each iteration of the loops.",
    "The loop invariants for this `matmul` function can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row, m, weight, input, output):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= m and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(col, n, row, weight, input, curr):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= n and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n`invariant1` checks the outer loop.

    "In the given example, the `matmul` function computes the matrix-vector product of the input matrix `weight` and the input vector `input`. The result `output` is a vector, where each element is computed by multiplying each row of the matrix with the input vector.\n\nLoop invariants for the two loops in `matmul` can be formulated as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row: int, m: int, weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int], output: List[int]):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= m and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(row: int, col: int, n: int, curr: int, weight: List[List[int]], input: List[int]):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= n and row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nIn `invariant1`, the matrix `weight[:row]` represents the `row` number of rows that have been processed so far. The output vector is thus the result of the matrix-vector multiplication of these processed rows with the input vector.\n\nIn `invariant2`, `weight[row][:col]` represents the portion of the current row that has been processed so far, and `input[:col]` represents the corresponding portion of the input vector. The current result `curr` for this row is then the sum of the element-wise multiplication of these two vectors, which is computed by the `reduce_sum` and `vec_elemwise_mul` functions.",
    "For the given test function, the loop invariants would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row, input, output, weight, m):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= m and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)\n\ndef invariant2(col, curr, input, output, row, weight, n):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= n and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. In the `invariant1` function, the invariant checks if the variable `row` lies within the valid range (0 to m) and if the `output` matches the result of the `matrix_vec_mul` function when applied on the slice of `weight` up to the current `row` and `input`.\n\n2. In the `invariant2` function, the invariant checks if the variable `col` lies within the valid range (0 to n) and if the `curr` matches the result of the `reduce_sum` and `vec_elemwise_mul` functions when applied on the slices of `weight[row]` and `input` up to the current `col`. The `vec_elemwise_mul` function multiplies corresponding elements of two vectors, and then `reduce_sum` adds up all these products, which is equivalent to the current sum of multiplied elements in the loop.",
    "For the given test function and the defined functions, we can write the loop invariant as below:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row, curr, input, output, weight):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row-1], input))\n\ndef invariant2(col, curr, input, output, row, weight):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row], input[:col]))\n```\n\nHere,\n1. `invariant1` is the loop invariant for the outer loop iterating over the rows of the weight matrix. It checks that the row index is within the valid range, and that the current output and curr values are correct based on the defined functions and the current state of the loop.\n2. `invariant2` is the loop invariant for the inner loop iterating over the columns of the input vector. It checks that the column index and the row index are within their valid ranges, and that the curr value is correct based on the defined functions and the current state of the loop.\n\nThese invariants hold at the start of the loops, at the end of the loops, and during each iteration of the loops, thus proving the correctness of the test function.",
    "Based on the instructions, you can define the loop invariants as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant1(row, curr, input, output, weight):\n    return row >= 0 and row <= len(weight) and output == reduce_sum(matrix_vec_mul(weight[:row], input)) and curr == 0\n\ndef invariant2(col, curr, input, output, row, weight):\n    return col >= 0 and col <= len(input) and row >= 0 and row < len(weight) and curr == reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))\n```\n\nHere, `invariant1` is for the outer loop and `invariant2` is for the inner loop. The invariants are proving the state of computation at each step of the loops.\n\nIn the first invariant, `row` is always within the bounds of the `weight` matrix and `output` is always equivalent to the result of matrix-vector multiplication up to the current `row`. `curr` is always reset to 0 at the beginning of the inner loop.\n\nIn the second invariant, `col` is always within the bounds of the `input` vector and `row` is always within the bounds of the `weight` matrix. `curr` is always equivalent to the result of element-wise multiplication and sum up to the current `col` in the current `row` of the `weight` matrix with the `input` vector. \n\nPlease note that if the loops in the original code have more complex operations or conditions, the invariants might be more complex as well.",

It also asserts that the current output is the result of the matrix-vector multiplication of the weight matrix up to the current row and the input vector. This assertion is based on the definition of matrix-vector multiplication, where each element in the output vector is the dot product of the corresponding row in the matrix and the input vector.\n\n2. `invariant2(col, curr, input, output, row, weight)` ensures that the column index is within the range of the input vector's length and the row index is within the range of the weight matrix's row count. It also asserts that the current value is the sum of the element-wise multiplication of the current row in the weight matrix up to the current column and the input vector up to the current column.

The invariant checks if `col` is within the valid range, and if the operation `reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(weight[row][:col], input[:col]))` equals to the current `curr`. This operation effectively computes the dot product of the current row in the weight matrix and the input vector, up to the current column."
