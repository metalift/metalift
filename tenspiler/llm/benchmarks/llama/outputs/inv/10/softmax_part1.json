    "The loop invariant for the given test function would be:\n\n```\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_val: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and max_val == reduce_max(input[:i])\n```\nThis invariant states that for each iteration of the loop, the current maximum value `max_val` is equal to the maximum value in the sub-list of `input` from index 0 to `i` (non-inclusive). The `i >= 0` and `i <= len(input)` conditions ensure that the index `i` is within the valid range of indices for the list `input`.",
    "Based on the provided test function, the loop invariant could be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_val: int, max_pos:int):\n    return max_pos >= 0 and max_pos <= len(input) and max_val == reduce_max(input[:max_pos])\n```\nIn this case, the invariant is stating that for each iteration of the loop, the maximum value (`max_val`) is equivalent to the maximum value in the slice of the list `input` from index 0 to `max_pos`. This is being evaluated at the start of each loop iteration, ensuring the condition holds true for all iterations.",
    "Based on the given example, the invariant for the `softmax_part1` function can be written as follows:\n\n```\ndef invariant(input: List[int], max_val: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(input) and max_val == reduce_max(input[:i])\n```\nIn this invariant, the `i` variable represents the current position of the loop, and `max_val` is the maximum value found so far in the input list up to the `i-th` position. The invariant states that the maximum value `max_val` is equal to the maximum value of the subset of the list up to the `i-th` position. This invariant holds before the loop starts (i.e., when `i = 0`, `max_val` is the maximum of an empty list, which is a valid initial condition), during the loop (as `max_val` is updated with the maximum value found so far), and at the end of the loop (when `max_val` is the maximum value of the entire list).",

The invariant is also maintained through each iteration of the loop, as `max_val` is updated to the maximum value seen so far in the input list up to index `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Finally, when the loop terminates, the invariant ensures that `max_val` is the maximum value in the input list up to index `max_pos`.",

The second condition `max_pos <= len(input)` ensures that the index `max_pos` never exceeds the length of the input list. The third condition `max_val == reduce_max(list_slice(input, 0, max_pos))` is the main loop invariant which ensures that `max_val` is always equal to the maximum value in the slice of the input list from index 0 to `max_pos`. Thus, at any point in the loop, `max_val` is the maximum value among the first `max_pos` elements of the input list.",
