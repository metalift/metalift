    "The invariant for the above program would be:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i, input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return i >= 1 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```",
    "Based on the instructions given, the loop invariant for the \"softmax_part1\" test function can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i, input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return i >= 1 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```\nThis loop invariant holds at the beginning of the loop (base case), remains true before each iteration (maintenance), and provides the desired property at the end of the loop (termination). The 'reduce_max' function is used to find the maximum value from the sliced list of input values from index 0 to 'i', which is the current iteration. The loop invariant ensures that 'max_val' is always the maximum value from the beginning of the list to the current index 'i'.",
    "Based on the provided example, the loop invariant for the test function can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i, input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return i>=1 and i<=max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```\n\nThis invariant reflects the properties that must be true before and after each iteration of the loop for the correctness of the program. We have:\n- `i>=1` and `i<=max_pos` which specify the range of the loop variable `i`.\n- `max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))` which ensures that `max_val` is always the maximum value of the subarray of `input` from index `0` to `i`.",
    "Based on the provided test function, the loop invariant would be:\n\n```\ndef invariant(i, input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return i > 0 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `i > 0`: This condition is true because the loop starts from 1.\n2. `i <= max_pos`: This condition is true because the loop runs until `i < max_pos`.\n3. `max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))`: This condition is the core part of the invariant. It states that at the i-th step of the iteration, `max_val` is equal to the maximum value of the subvector of `input` from index 0 to `i`. This is always maintained during the iteration.",
    "The loop invariant for the given `test` function is:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(i, input, max_pos, max_val):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= max_pos and max_val == reduce_max(vec_slice(input, 0, i))\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop because `i` is initialized as 1 and `max_val` is equal to `input[0]`, which is the maximum value in the sliced input vector from 0 to `i` (which is 1 at the beginning, so it's just the first element).\n\nDuring each iteration of the loop, if `input[i]` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated to `input[i]`. The invariant condition still holds true as `max_val` is still the maximum value in the sliced input vector from 0 to `i`.\n\nAfter the loop, the invariant ensures that `max_val` is the maximum value in the input vector from 0 to `max_pos`, which is the assertion that needs to be proved. Therefore, the given loop invariant proves the assertion in the `test` function.",

The invariant holds true before the loop begins (as `max_val` is initialized to the first element of the input list), and is maintained with each iteration of the loop (as `max_val` is updated if the current element of the input list is greater than the current `max_val`).
