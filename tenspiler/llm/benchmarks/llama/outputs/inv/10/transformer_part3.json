    "Here is the loop invariant for the given code based on the provided instructions and functions:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int) -> bool:\n    return (i >= 0 and\n            i <= hidden_dim and\n            output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), \n                                       scalar_vec_div(1, \n                                                      vec_scalar_add(1, \n                                                                     vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, \n                                                                                            vec_slice(input, 0, i)), \n                                                                              lambda x: integer_exp(x))))) and\n            curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))))\n```\n\nThis invariant states that at the beginning of each iteration of the loop:\n\n- The loop variable `i` is between 0 and `hidden_dim`, inclusive.\n- The `output` list is the element-wise multiplication of the first `i` elements of the `input` list and the inverse of the addition of 1 and the exponential mapping of the subtraction of 0 from the first `i` elements of the `input` list.\n- The `curr` variable is equal to the `i`-th element of the `input` list multiplied by the inverse of the addition of 1 to the exponential of the negation of the `i`-th element of the `input` list.",
    "The invariant for the given code would be as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], hidden_dim:int, curr: int, i:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),integer_exp)))) and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))\n```\n\nExplanation: \n- The `i >= 0`  ensures that the loop variable `i` is always greater than or equals to 0.\n- The `i <= hidden_dim` ensures that the loop variable `i` is always less than or equals to `hidden_dim`. This condition comes from the loop condition `i < hidden_dim`.\n- The `output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),integer_exp))))` ensures that the output at any point in the loop is equal to the expected output as defined in the assert statement.\n- The `curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` ensures that the current value `curr` is always equals to the right-hand side of the equation as defined in the loop body.",
    "In the provided code, the `test` function is named `transformer_part3`.

The `output` is compared with the expected result of the operation that is performed in the loop for the first `i` elements of `input`. The `curr` variable is compared with the expected result of the operation that is performed in the loop for the `i`th element of `input` (since Python uses 0-based indexing, `i`th element corresponds to the element at index `i`).",
    "Based on the given defined functions and the test function, following is the loop invariant:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x))))) and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))\n```\nHere, \n1. `i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim` ensures that the loop index is within the valid range.\n2. `output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), lambda x: integer_exp(x)))))` asserts the current state of the output vector, ensuring that each element matches the expected result.\n3. `curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` asserts the current element being processed.\nThis invariant holds true before the loop begins, during each iteration, and when the loop is completed.",
    "Based on the provided instructions, the loop invariant for the given function `transformer_part3` can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)))) and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))\n```\nPlease note that the function `integer_exp` in the loop invariant is used as `lambda x: integer_exp(x)`. The `input[i]` at the end of the invariant corresponds to the current value being processed in the loop in the original function. The output is derived from the corresponding vec_elemwise_mul operation over the defined functions. I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
    "From the given code, the loop invariant can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], hidden_dim: int, i: int, curr: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))) and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),lambda x: integer_exp(x)))))\n```\n\nNote: \n- The `input` is a list of integers, which is used as input data.\n- `output` is the list of integers that is being built up in the loop.\n- `hidden_dim` is the number of elements in the input list.\n- `i` is the current index in the loop.\n- `curr` is the current element of the input list that is being processed.\n\nIn the loop invariant, we're asserting that the current index `i` is within the bounds of the `input` list, the current element `curr` is correctly calculated based on the current index and input list, and the `output` list is the correct partial result based on the input list and current index.",
    "The invariant for your given function would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], hidden_dim: int, i: int, curr: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))) and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),lambda x: integer_exp(x)))))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe are looping through `hidden_dim` elements of `input`, and for each element at index `i`, `curr` is calculated as `input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))`. Therefore, this equation forms part of our invariant.\n\nIn the output, for each `i`, we are pushing `curr` into the `output` vector. This is equivalent to multiplying the first `i` elements in `input` by `1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))`, which can be achieved by the function `vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),lambda x: integer_exp(x)))))`. Hence, this forms the other part of our invariant.",
    "Based on the provided test function and defined functions, the invariant for the loop in the test function can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and \\\n           output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)))) and \\\n           curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `i >= 0` and `i <= hidden_dim` ensures that `i` is within the valid range.\n- `output` is equal to the element-wise multiplication of the slice of `input` from index 0 to `i` and the division of 1 by the addition of 1 to the mapped values of the slice of `input` from index 0 to `i` where each value is subtracted from 0 and the `integer_exp` function is applied.\n- `curr` is equal to the `i`-th value of `input` multiplied by the division of 1 by the addition of 1 to the exponent of the subtraction of `input[i]` from 0. This corresponds to the computation of `curr` in each iteration of the loop in the test function.",
    "In the given code, the `transformer_part3` function processes each element of the `input` vector up to `hidden_dim`. The operation performed in the loop is equivalent to element-wise multiplication of a slice of `input` vector (from 0 to `hidden_dim`) and the reciprocal of 1 plus the exponential (base 3) of the negative of the same slice. This is achieved by using the defined functions `vec_slice`, `vec_elemwise_mul`, `scalar_vec_div`, `vec_scalar_add` and `vec_map`. The `vec_map` function in turn uses a lambda function to apply `integer_exp` to each element.\n\nThe loop invariant can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i), scalar_vec_div(1, vec_scalar_add(1, vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)), integer_exp)))) and curr == output[-1] if output else 0\n```\n\nThis invariant checks that `i` is within expected bounds (0 to `hidden_dim`), and that the `output` up to the current loop iteration correctly reflects the element-wise operation described above. It also confirms that `curr` is equal to the last element in `output`.\n\nThis invariant will hold before the loop starts (as `output` will be an empty list and `curr` will be 0), during each iteration (as each element is correctly processed and added to `output`), and at the end of the loop (where `output` will hold the fully processed vector). Therefore, it correctly reflects the state and correctness of the loop at all stages of execution.",
    "In the given example, we are asked to find the loop invariant in the `transformer_part3` function by using the defined functions. The loop invariant can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(input: List[int], output: List[int], curr: int, hidden_dim: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= hidden_dim and output == vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, i),scalar_vec_div(1,vec_scalar_add(1,vec_map(scalar_vec_sub(0, vec_slice(input, 0, i)),integer_exp)))) and curr == input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))\n```\n\nThe invariant evaluates to True before, during, and after executing the loop. The invariant is based on the operation performed inside the loop on the `output` and `curr` variables, where `output` is calculated using `vec_elemwise_mul`, `vec_slice`, `scalar_vec_div`, `vec_scalar_add`, `vec_map`, `scalar_vec_sub` and `integer_exp` functions and `curr` is calculated using direct operations. The `i` variable is also included in the invariant to ensure it lies in the range of `0` to `hidden_dim`."
