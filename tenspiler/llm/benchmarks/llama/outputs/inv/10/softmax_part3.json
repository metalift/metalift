    "In the given test function, the loop invariant would be the total sum of the elements in the array `output` from index `0` to `i` at any point during the loop. This can be described using the provided `reduce_sum` and `list_slice` functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(output: List[int], sum: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(output) and sum == reduce_sum(list_slice(output, 0, i))\n```\n\nThis invariant indicates that for every `i` from `0` to `max_pos`, the variable `sum` is always equal to the sum of elements in `output` from index `0` to `i`. This condition holds true before the loop starts, during each iteration, and after the loop ends, making it a valid loop invariant.",
    "Based on the provided defined functions and the test function, the loop invariant can be expressed as follows:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(output: List[int], sum:int, i:int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(output) and sum == reduce_sum(list_slice(output, 0, i))\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe loop invariant is a condition that is initially true and remains true after each iteration of a loop. It is used to prove the correctness of a program.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant is defined as follows:\n- `i >= 0` : This condition ensures that the index `i` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is always true as `i` is initialized as 0 and only increments in each loop iteration.\n- `i <= len(output)` : This condition ensures that `i` never exceeds the length of the list `output`. This is always true as `i` increments by 1 in each loop iteration and the loop terminates when `i` equals `len(output)`.\n- `sum == reduce_sum(list_slice(output, 0, i))` : This condition checks that the variable `sum` is always equal to the sum of the elements in the list `output` from index 0 to `i`. This is always true as `sum` is incremented by `output[i]` in each loop iteration and `i` increments by 1.",
    "Based on your provided test function, here is the loop invariant:\n\n```python\ndef invariant(output: List[int], sum: int, i: int):\n    return i >= 0 and i <= len(output) and sum == reduce_sum(output[:i])\n```",

This condition is maintained at the start of each loop iteration, hence proving the assertion to be true.",

The conditions `i >= 0` and `i <= len(output)` ensure that `i` is within the valid index range of the `output` list.",
