    "The test function `fdtd_2d_part1` in C++ is performing an operation on a 2D vector `hz` and returns a new 2D vector `out`.

The `vec_slice` function is used to select the required elements from each row of `hz` for subtraction. The `vec_elemwise_sub` function performs the subtraction. The result is then multiplied by 2 using `vec_scalar_mul`. Finally, `matrix_row_slice` is used to select the rows from 0 to `nx`.",

If `ny > 1`, we subtract `hz[i][j - 1]` from `hz[i][j]` and multiply by `2`. If `ny <= 1`, we return a matrix of zeros with the same dimensions as the input matrix (since `j` would not be less than `ny` and the loop would not be executed).",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), 0, ny - 1))), \n        matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx))\n    )\n\n```\nThis Python function `fdtd_2d_part1` is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1`. It takes the difference between each element in the `hz` matrix and the previous element in the same row, multiplies each difference by 2, and returns the result as a new matrix. Note that the columns in the `hz` matrix are 0-indexed, so the j-th column in the C++ function corresponds to the (j-1)-th index in Python.",
    "The given C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_transpose(\n        [\n            vec_elemwise_mul(\n                vec_scalar_mul(2, vec_elemwise_sub(matrix_col_slice(hz, j, ny), matrix_col_slice(hz, j-1, ny-1))),\n                [1 if i < nx else 0 for i in range(len(hz[0]))]\n            )\n            for j in range(1, ny)\n        ]\n    )\n```\n\nIn the rewritten function, we are creating a list comprehension `for j in range(1, ny)`, which replaces the inner loop in the C++ function. For each iteration, we subtract `hz[i][j - 1]` from `hz[i][j]` using `vec_elemwise_sub(matrix_col_slice(hz, j, ny), matrix_col_slice(hz, j-1, ny-1))`, then multiply it by 2 using `vec_scalar_mul(2, ...)`.\n\nThen, we create a boolean mask `[1 if i < nx else 0 for i in range(len(hz[0]))]` to ensure that the computations are only performed on the first `nx` elements (replacing the outer loop in the C++ function).\n\nFinally, we element-wise multiply the results of the subtraction and scaling with the boolean mask using `vec_elemwise_mul(...)`, and transpose the matrix using `matrix_transpose(...)`, as the original C++ function was performing column operations, while the Python functions are performing row operations.\n\nIt is important to note that the Python version of the function does not have the exact same structure as the C++ version, mainly because Python allows for more concise and high-level operations (like list comprehensions, slicing, and high-level functions), while C++ requires explicit looping.",

Applies a lambda function to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. The lambda function multiplies by 2 the difference of the two elements.

This is done to replicate the behavior of the for loop in the original C++ function where the operations were applied `nx` times.",
    "Based on the provided C++ function, the equivalent Python function that uses the defined functions would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        vec_map(firsts(hz), lambda x: 2 * x),\n        vec_map(firsts(matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny)), lambda x: 2 * x),\n        lambda x, y: x - y,\n    )\n```\nHere is the explanation:\n\n1. The function `fdtd_2d_part1` takes three arguments: `nx`, `ny` and `hz` (2D matrix). It returns a 2D matrix.\n\n2. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to perform operations on two 2D matrices. In this case, it is used to subtract the values of two matrices.\n\n3. The `vec_map` function is used to multiply all elements of a vector by 2. The `firsts` function is used to get the first element of each row in the `hz` matrix.\n\n4. The `matrix_col_slice` function is used to get all the elements from the second column to `ny` column from the `hz` matrix.\n\n5. The lambda function `lambda x, y: x - y` is used to subtract the corresponding elements from the two matrices.",
    "The C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` computes a matrix `out` where each element is twice the difference between the current and previous element in each row of the input matrix `hz`. The size of the `out` matrix is `nx` by `ny-1`.\n\nTo rewrite this function using the provided Python functions, I would use the `matrix_elemwise_sub` function to compute the difference between the elements of `hz` and their preceding elements. After that, I would use the `matrix_scalar_mul` function to multiply the result by 2.\n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), 1, ny)))\n```\n\nThis function first slices `hz` to a matrix of size `nx` by `ny` using `matrix_row_slice`. Then it computes the difference between the elements and their preceding elements in each row using `matrix_elemwise_sub`. The result is then multiplied by 2 using `matrix_scalar_mul`.",
    "Given the constraints of your task, you should use the `matrix_row_slice` function to iterate over the rows of `hz`, the `matrix_col_slice` function to iterate over the columns, the `vec_elemwise_sub` function to subtract the current element from the previous one, the `vec_scalar_mul` function to multiply the result by 2, and finally, the `matrix_col_slice` function to eliminate the first element of each row. In Python, the equivalent function would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return_var = matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(\n        vec_scalar_mul(\n            2, vec_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny),\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny-1)\n            )\n        ), 0, nx-1),\n        1, ny\n    )\n    return return_var\n```\n\nIn this function, `matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny)` represents the current element `hz[i][j]`, and `matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny-1)` represents the previous element `hz[i][j - 1]`. The subtraction of these two matrices gives us a matrix of differences. This matrix is then multiplied by 2 and sliced to eliminate the first element of each row, resulting in the desired output.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the provided functions handle errors and exceptions properly (like dividing by zero or accessing elements out of the array bounds). In a real-world scenario, you should add error handling code to make your function more robust."
