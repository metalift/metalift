    "Here's how the `fdtd_2d_part1` function from C++ could be rewritten using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_slice(\n        matrix_selection_two_args(\n            matrix_scalar_mul(\n                2,\n                matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                    matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                    matrix_col_slice(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), 0, ny-1),\n                ),\n            ),\n            matrix_scalar_mul(0, matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx)),\n            lambda x, y: ite(y != 0, x, y),\n        ),\n        0,\n        nx,\n    )\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Slices the `hz` matrix to only include the first `nx` rows.\n2. Subtracts the matrix resulting from slicing the first `nx` rows and the first `ny - 1` columns of `hz` from the sliced `hz`.\n3. Multiplies the result by 2.\n4. Applies element-wise selection between the resulting matrix and a matrix of zeros with the same shape. This operation replaces the 0s in the original matrix with the corresponding values in the subtracted matrix.\n5. Slices the resulting matrix to only include the first `nx` rows.",
    "The C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions and constants like this:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), matrix_col_slice(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), 0, ny-1))), matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_slice(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), 1, ny)))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx)` selects the first `nx` rows of `hz`.\n- `matrix_col_slice(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), 0, ny-1)` selects the first `ny - 1` columns of the selected rows.\n- `matrix_slice(matrix_slice(hz, 0, nx), 1, ny)` selects the last `ny - 1` columns of the selected rows.\n- `matrix_elemwise_sub(...)` performs element-wise subtraction of these two matrices, effectively subtracting each element `hz[i][j - 1]` from `hz[i][j]`.\n- `matrix_scalar_mul(2, ...)` multiplies each element of the resulting matrix by 2, which is equivalent to `2 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1])` in the original function.\n- `matrix_elemwise_mul(...)` multiplies this matrix by the constant matrix of 2 to get the final output.",
    "The `fdtd_2d_part1` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_slice([vec_elemwise_mul(constants[2], vec_elemwise_sub(list_slice(hz_row, constants[1], ny), list_slice(hz_row, constants[0], ny - constants[1]))) for hz_row in hz[:nx]], constants[0], nx)\n```\n\nThis Python function uses list comprehension to iterate over the `hz` matrix, and for each row it creates a new row by subtracting the previous element from the current one, and then multiplying the result by 2. The `matrix_slice` function is used to ensure that the output matrix has the same dimensions as the input (`nx` rows).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the operations:\n1. `vec_elemwise_sub(list_slice(hz_row, constants[1], ny), list_slice(hz_row, constants[0], ny - constants[1]))`: For each row in the `hz` matrix, it creates a new list by subtracting the previous element from the current one. The `list_slice` function is used to get the current and previous elements.\n2. `vec_elemwise_mul(constants[2], ...)`: It multiplies the result from step 1 by 2.\n3. `[... for hz_row in hz[:nx]]`: It does the above operations for each row in the `hz` matrix.\n4. `matrix_slice(..., constants[0], nx)`: It ensures that the output matrix has the same number of rows as the input."
