    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the provided functions. As per the instructions, we can't use for or while loops, so we use recursion and vectorized functions instead.\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return ite(nx == 0, [], [vec_elemwise_mul([2] * (ny - 1), vec_elemwise_sub(hz[0][1:ny], hz[0][:ny - 1]))] + fdtd_2d_part1(nx - 1, ny, hz[1:]))\n```\n\nThis function returns the same result as the given C++ function. It uses the provided vectorized functions to perform operations on the elements of the matrix `hz`. The function `vec_elemwise_sub` subtracts two vectors element-wise, `vec_elemwise_mul` multiplies two vectors element-wise, and `ite` is used to decide when to stop the recursion. The recursion is stopped when `nx` reaches 0. \n\nPlease note that the indices in Python start from 0, which is different from C++. So, the indices in the Python code are adjusted accordingly.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return_var = matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_elemwise_sub(hz, matrix_selection_two_args(hz, hz, lambda x, y: ite(y > 0, hz[x][y - 1], 0)))),\n        matrix_selection_two_args(hz, hz, lambda x, y: ite(y < ny, 1, 0))\n    )\n    return return_var\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe given C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` is computing 2 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]) for each (i, j) in the range (0, nx) x (1, ny) and storing the results in a 2D vector `out`. \n\nIn Python, we do the same operation using the provided functions. `matrix_elemwise_sub(hz, matrix_selection_two_args(hz, hz, lambda x, y: ite(y > 0, hz[x][y - 1], 0)))` calculates `hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]` for each (i, j).

Finally, `matrix_selection_two_args(hz, hz, lambda x, y: ite(y < ny, 1, 0))` returns a matrix that has 1 for all elements with j < ny and 0 otherwise. \n\nMultiplying this matrix with the previous matrix using `matrix_elemwise_mul(...)` ensures that only the elements with j < ny in the original matrix are retained. All other elements become 0, which is equivalent to the given C++ function not pushing elements with j >= ny into `row_vec`.\n",

It subtracts the second sub-matrix from the first one, which is equivalent to `hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1]` in the original C++ function.\n- The outer `matrix_scalar_mul` function multiplies the result by 2, which is equivalent to `2 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1])` in the original C++ function.\n- The outermost `matrix_elemwise_mul` function multiplies the result by a matrix of ones.

This is equivalent to the operation performed in the C++ `fdtd_2d_part1` function.\n\nPlease note: The provided Python functions do not support negative indexing which is implicitly used in the original C++ function when `j` is 0. This Python function assumes that the `hz` matrix has at least one column, and that `ny` is the number of columns.

For each `i` and `j`, it computes `2 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1])` and adds it to the new 2D list. In the Python code, we replace the nested for loop with a list comprehension and use the `vec_elemwise_sub()`, `vec_scalar_mul()` functions to replicate the functionality.

The `row_op` function takes a row, creates a shifted copy of it (using slicing to exclude the last element), and then subtracts the original row (without its last element) from the shifted copy. The result is then multiplied by 2, as specified in the original C++ function. This is equivalent to the inner loop in the C++ function. The outer loop is implemented via the `vec_map` function, which applies `row_op` to each row in `hz`.\n\nIt's worth noting that this Python function assumes that the `hz` matrix is not empty and that all its rows have the same length.",

Finally, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to select only the values for `j > 0`.",
    "Given the constraints and the available functions, the `fdtd_2d_part1` function can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_elemwise_mul(\n            matrix_scalar_mul(2, hz),\n            matrix_elemwise_sub(hz, matrix_elemwise_add([[0] * (ny - 1)], hz[:-1]))\n        ),\n        [[0]*ny],\n        lambda x, y: ite(y != 0, x, 0)\n    )\n```\n\nIn the function above, the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function is used to multiply each element of `hz` by 2.

In this case, `x` is the result of the elementwise multiplication and subtraction, and `y` is a matrix of the same size as `hz` but with all elements set to zero.

The second argument to `matrix_elemwise_mul` is a matrix of the same size as `hz`, but with the last element of each row replaced with 0. This ensures that the operation is only applied to the first `ny - 1` elements of each row, as in the C++ code.\n- The `matrix_elemwise_mul` is only applied to the first `nx` rows of the matrix, as in the C++ code, by slicing the matrix with `[0: nx]`.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the provided functions handle cases where the input matrices are not of the same size, as the `matrix_elemwise_sub`, `matrix_scalar_mul`, and `matrix_elemwise_mul` functions would require matrices of the same size in a straightforward translation of the C++ code.",

This operation can be achieved using the `vec_elemwise_sub` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions. Since we are applying this operation to all rows and we cannot use a loop, we will use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a function to every pair of rows of two matrices. \n\nWe will use `matrix_selection_two_args` to subtract the `hz` matrix from itself, but we will shift the second matrix to the right by one column (represented by slicing the matrix from column 1 to the end). The subtraction will result in a matrix of the differences between each consecutive pair of columns. We then use `matrix_scalar_mul` to multiply every element of this matrix by 2. \n\nThe Python equivalent function is:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_selection_two_args(hz, [row[1:] for row in hz], lambda x, y: x-y))\n```\nNote: This assumes that nx and ny are the dimensions of the `hz` matrix, but are not used directly in the function as the operations are applied to all elements of the `hz` matrix.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(\n    nx: int,\n    ny: int,\n    hz: List[List[int]]\n) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(\n            2, \n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                hz, \n                matrix_elemwise_add(\n                    [[0]*ny] + hz[:-1], \n                    [[0]*(ny-1) for _ in range(nx)]\n                )\n            )\n        ), \n        [[0]*(ny-1) for _ in range(nx)]\n    )\n```\n\nThe `fdtd_2d_part1` function first subtracts each element of `hz` with the element to its left (using `matrix_elemwise_sub` and `matrix_elemwise_add` functions). Then, it multiplies each element of the resulting matrix by 2 (using `matrix_scalar_mul` function). Finally, it removes the last column from the resulting matrix to match the dimensions of the output matrix in the original C++ function. This is achieved by multiplying the matrix with a mask matrix where the last column is all zeros (using `matrix_elemwise_mul` function).",

Then, the original matrix is subtracted from the shifted matrix. The result is multiplied by 2. Finally, multiplication with `[[1 if j != 0 else 0 for j in range(ny)] for _ in range(nx)]` is used to set the first column to zero, emulating the behaviour of the original function, which does not calculate the value for j=0.",

In the Python function, we have used the `matrix_elemwise_mul`, `matrix_scalar_mul`, `matrix_elemwise_sub`, `matrix_selection_two_args`, `ite` functions to achieve the same result as the C++ function. The function takes three parameters: `nx`, `ny`, and `hz`. The function first multiplies each element in the `hz` matrix by 2, then it subtracts each element in the `hz` matrix from the next element in the same row. Finally, it selects the elements from the resulting matrix if their index is less than `nx`.",
