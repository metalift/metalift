    "The given `fdtd_2d_part1` function in C++ can be rewritten as the following Python function using the provided functions. The Python function will compute the same result as the C++ function but without using any for/while loops:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n        matrix_row_slice(hz, 1, ny),\n        lambda x, y: 2 * (y - x)\n    )\n```\nThis function takes the first `nx` rows and the first `ny` rows from the `hz` matrix, then for each pair of corresponding elements from the two matrices, it subtracts the element from the first matrix from the element from the second matrix and multiplies the result by 2. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the lambda function to each pair of corresponding elements from the two matrices, effectively replacing the nested for loop from the original C++ function.",
    "The `fdtd_2d_part1` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n        matrix_row_slice(matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny), 0, nx),\n        lambda x, y: 2 * (x - y)\n    )\n```\nThe `matrix_row_slice` function is used to select the first `nx` rows of the matrix `hz` and `matrix_col_slice` function is used to select the columns from 1 to `ny` of the matrix `hz`.\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to perform element-wise operation on two matrices. In this case, the operation is `lambda x, y: 2 * (x - y)`, which essentially multiplies the difference of corresponding elements in the two matrices by 2.\n\nThis function is equivalent to the original C++ `fdtd_2d_part1` function.",
    "The given C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` takes as input the dimensions of a 2D grid (nx, ny) and a 2D integer vector `hz`. For each row i in the range [0, nx), it creates a new row vector by subtracting the previous element from the current element in `hz[i]`, multiplying the result by 2, and then appending this to `row_vec`. This is repeated for all elements in the range [1, ny). The row vectors are then appended to `out`, which is returned.\n\nThe equivalent Python function using the provided functions could be written as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n        matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), 1, ny),\n        lambda a, b: 2 * (b - a)\n    )\n```\n\nIn the Python function `fdtd_2d_part1`, `matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx)` trims `hz` to the first `nx` rows. `matrix_col_slice(matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), 1, ny)` trims the result to the columns in the range [1, ny). `matrix_selection_two_args` then applies the lambda function `lambda a, b: 2 * (b - a)` element-wise to each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices. This function subtracts the element `a` from the element `b` and multiplies the result by 2, which is equivalent to the body of the inner loop in the C++ function.",
    "The given C++ function `fdtd_2d_part1` performs a calculation on a 2D vector `hz` and produces a new 2D vector as output. The calculation involves subtracting the value of the current element in `hz` and its left neighbor, then multiplying by 2.\n\nUsing the provided functions, we can translate this to Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return_var = matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(\n            2,\n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny),\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny - 1)\n            )\n        ),\n        [[1]* (ny - 1) for _ in range(nx)]\n    )\n    return return_var\n```\nIn this Python function, `matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny)` and `matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny - 1)` are used to generate two new matrices where each one is shifted one column to the right or left relative to the original `hz` matrix. The `matrix_elemwise_sub` function is then used to subtract these two matrices element-wise. \n\nThe result is then multiplied by 2 using `matrix_scalar_mul` function.\n\nFinally, the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function is used to multiply the resultant matrix with another matrix of 1s of the same size to keep the dimensions consistent.",
    "The `fdtd_2d_part1` function can be rewritten using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(\n            2,\n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                vec_elemwise_mul(\n                    matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                    matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny-1)\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n```\n\nThis Python function uses the provided functions for matrix and vector operations to achieve the same effect as the original C++ function. It slices the `hz` matrix according to the `nx` and `ny` inputs, performs element-wise subtraction and multiplication, and finally multiplies the result by `2`.",
    "Based on the provided functions, the `fdtd_2d_part1` function can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(\n    nx: int,\n    ny: int,\n    hz: List[List[int]]\n) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_vec_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(\n            2, \n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                    matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                    matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny)\n                )\n            )\n        ),\n        [1 for _ in range(ny - 1)]\n    )\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `matrix_row_slice` function is used to select a subset of rows from the `hz` matrix equivalent to the variable `nx` in the original function. The `matrix_elemwise_sub` function is used to subtract the (i, j-1)th elements from the (i, j)th elements in the `hz` matrix. The `matrix_scalar_mul` function is used to multiply each element in the resulting matrix by 2. Finally, the `matrix_vec_mul` function is used to multiply each row of the resulting matrix by a vector of ones of length `ny - 1`, effectively summing up the elements in each row.",
    "The C++ function can be rewritten into Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(matrix_scalar_mul(2, matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny), matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny - 1))), [[1] * (ny - 1) for _ in range(nx)])\n```\nHere is a detailed explanation of the conversion:\n\n1. The inner loop in the C++ function calculates the difference between the current and previous element in each row of the `hz` matrix, multiplies the result by 2, and appends it to a new row vector. This operation is equivalent to subtracting a sliced version of the `hz` matrix (excluding the first column) from another sliced version of the `hz` matrix (excluding the last column), and then multiplying the result by 2. This can be achieved with the `matrix_col_slice`, `matrix_elemwise_sub` and `matrix_scalar_mul` functions.\n\n2. The outer loop in the C++ function repeats the operation described above for each row in the `hz` matrix and appends the result to a new matrix. This is equivalent to applying the operation to the entire `hz` matrix at once. \n\n3. The `matrix_elemwise_mul` function is used to ensure that the operation is applied element-wise across the entire matrix. The second argument to `matrix_elemwise_mul` is a matrix of ones, which effectively multiplies every element in the first argument by 1, leaving their values unchanged.\n\n4. The size of the matrix of ones is determined by `nx` (the number of rows in the `hz` matrix) and `ny - 1` (the number of columns in the `hz` matrix minus 1, because the first column is excluded in the calculation).",
    "The original `fdtd_2d_part1` function in C++ is taking a 2D vector `hz` and performing some operations on the elements. For each row `i`, it is taking each column `j` (from 1 to `ny` exclusive) and calculating `2 * (hz[i][j] - hz[i][j - 1])`. \n\nIn Python, using provided functions, we can write this as:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_transpose([\n        vec_elemwise_mul(\n            vec_scalar_mul(2, vec_elemwise_sub(\n                vec_slice(hz[i], 1, ny),\n                vec_slice(hz[i], 0, ny - 1)\n            ))\n        )\n        for i in range(nx)\n    ])\n```\n\nFor rewriting the function as per the instructions, we can't use for/while loops or intermediate variables. We also need to use the existing provided functions. Here's how it can be done:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(2,\n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 1, ny),\n                matrix_col_slice(hz, 0, ny - 1)\n            )\n        ),\n        [[1]*ny]*nx\n    )\n```\n\nPlease note that this function will work as per the instructions, but it will produce a matrix of size `nx x ny`. If you need the same size as the input matrix `hz`, you might need to slice the output matrix to match the size. However, the provided functions don't support this operation.",
    "To rewrite the `fdtd_2d_part1` function, we can use the `matrix_row_slice` function to slice the rows from `hz` matrix and use `matrix_elemwise_sub` function to subtract corresponding elements from `hz` and its shifted version. The `vec_scalar_mul` function is used to multiply the result by `2`.\n\nThe `hz` matrix is sliced from `0` to `ny`, and then each row is sliced from `1` to `ny` to create a shifted version of the `hz` matrix. \n\nThe rewritten function is:\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_mul(\n        matrix_scalar_mul(2, \n            matrix_elemwise_sub(\n                matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx),\n                matrix_row_slice(\n                    [vec_slice(row, 1, ny) for row in hz], 0, nx)\n            )\n        ), \n        matrix_row_slice([[1]*(ny-1)], 0, nx)\n    )\n```\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function. It does the same operations and returns the same output. The difference is that the Python function uses function composition instead of loops.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the `fdtd_2d_part1` function using provided functions and constants. The rewritten program is a single return statement and does not use for/while loops. The function `matrix_row_slice` is used to slice the matrix `hz` from 0 to `nx`. For each row, `vec_slice` is used to slice the vectors from 1 to `ny` and `matrix_elemwise_sub` is used to subtract the sliced row from its previous row. `matrix_scalar_mul` is then used to multiply each element by 2.\n\n```python\ndef fdtd_2d_part1(nx: int, ny: int, hz: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_mul(\n        2, \n        matrix_elemwise_sub(\n            matrix_row_slice(hz, 0, nx), \n            vec_slice(matrix_row_slice(hz, 1, nx), 1, ny)\n        )\n    )\n```"
