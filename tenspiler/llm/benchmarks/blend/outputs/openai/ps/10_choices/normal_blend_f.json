    "The provided C++ function `normal_blend_f()` takes in three parameters: two integer vectors (base & active) and an integer opacity. It blends the two vectors by multiplying the 'active' vector with the opacity and the 'base' vector with (1 - opacity), then adds those together.\n\nAs per the requirements, I'll rewrite this function in Python using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```",
    "Given the constraints and available functions, the C++ function can be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n\n```\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. Both perform an element-wise operation on given vectors `base` and `active` with a scalar `opacity`. The python function uses `vec_scalar_mul` to multiply each element of `active` and `base` with `opacity` and `1 - opacity` respectively. Then using `vec_elemwise_add`, it adds these two result vectors element wise.",
    "The provided `normal_blend_f` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python, using the provided functions, as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nThis python function does the exact same operations as the C++ version. It iterates over each element of the `base` and `active` vectors, multiplies each element in `active` by `opacity`, each element in `base` by `(1 - opacity)`, and then adds these two resulting vectors element-wise to produce the output.\nThe provided functions used are:\n- `vec_scalar_mul(a, x)`: which multiplies a scalar `a` with each element of vector `x`.\n- `vec_elemwise_add(x, y)`: which adds vector `x` and `y` element-wise.\nNotably, the looping is hidden inside these functions and our final python function complies with the restrictions: it only consists of a single return statement and does not use any loops.",
    "Here is the Python version of your C++ function using only the provided function set:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```",
    "The translated function in python using the provided functions would be:\n\n```Python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n``` \n\nThis is a direct translation:\n* We use the `vec_scalar_mul` function to achieve the scalar multiplication `opacity * active[i]` and `(1 - opacity) * base[i]`.\n* We use the `vec_elemwise_add` function to add these two vectors elementwise which is equivalent to `out.push_back(opacity * active[i] + (1 - opacity) * base[i])` inside the loop in your C++ code. This operation is performed for all the elements in 'base' and 'active' vectors.",
    "Based on the provided function definitions, the equivalent Python function of the given C++ function is:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```",
    "Based on the provided definitions and the target function, the `normal_blend_f` can be rewritten as follows, using a combination of `vec_elemwise_mul`, `vec_elemwise_add`, and `vec_elemwise_sub` provided:\n\n```\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_elemwise_mul(opacity, active), vec_elemwise_mul(1-opacity, base))\n```\n\nIn the `normal_blend_f`, we are just computing a new vector out from the weighted sum of two input vectors. As the provided/vector element-wise operations are just essentially doing the same but for element-wise computation, we can map the loop logic into a combination of calls to these functions.\n\n1. `vec_elemwise_mul(opacity, active)`: Performs element-wise multiplication of the `active` vector with the `opacity`. \n\n2. `vec_elemwise_mul(1-opacity, base)`: Performs element-wise multiplication of the `base` vector with `(1 - opacity)`. \n\n3. `vec_elemwise_add(...)`: Adds the results of 1 and 2 together element-wise to create the final vector.",
    "The `normal_blend_f` function in C++ performs a normalization blending operation for each pair of corresponding elements in the 'base' and 'active' vectors, using the provided 'opacity' value. The result is a new vector where each element is the result of the normalization blend.\n\nGiven no use of loops is allowed, we need to use elementwise addition and multiplication function and scalar vector addition and subtraction functions for this operation. Here is the direct translation of the `normal_blend_f` function into Python using provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThe `vec_scalar_mul` function multiplies every element of the vector ('base' & 'active') by the scalar (`opacity` & `1 - opacity`). The `vec_elemwise_add` function then adds corresponding elements of the two result vectors together to form the final output vector. This emulates the same functionality of the C++ version of `normal_blend_f`.",
    "You can rewrite the `normal_blend_f` function with provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n  return vec_elemwise_add(\n      vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), \n      vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)\n  )\n```\nThe `vec_scalar_mul` function multiplies each element in a vector with a scalar value, then `vec_elemwise_add` adds corresponding elements in two vectors. This effectively simulates the operation done inside the loop in the original C++ function.",
    "The provided `test` function in C++ is performing an element-wise operation on two given arrays, `base` and `active`, where the operation is multiplication with `opacity` of `active[i]`, addition to it with multiplication of `(1-opacity)` and `base[i]` for each corresponding element in the arrays. We can achieve this with our provided functions.\n\nGiven function and constants,\n\n```C++\nvector<int> normal_blend_f(vector<int> base, vector<int> active, int opacity)\n{\n  vector<int> out;\n  for (int i = 0; i < base.size(); ++i)\n    out.push_back(opacity * active[i] + (1 - opacity) * base[i]);\n  return out;\n}\n```\n\nRewritten function, \n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1-opacity, base))\n```\n\nLet me explain a little,\n\nWe can use our `vec_scalar_mul(a: int, x: List[int]) -> List[int]` function to multiply each element `opacity` and `active[i]` and `1 - opacity` and `base[i]` which was `opacity * active[i]` and `(1 - opacity) * base[i]` operation in the c++ code.\n\nFurthermore, we can use our `vec_elemwise_add(x: List[int], y: List[int]) -> List[int]` function to perform the `+` operation between the results of the before mentioned multiplication, which was `opacity * active[i] + (1 - opacity) * base[i]` operation in the c++ code.\n\nPlease note that the provided code and the rewritten function perform the operation assuming the sizes of base and active vectors are the same, which is not checked in either code."
