    "The given C++ function `transformer_part4` performs element-wise multiplication of two vectors, `input1` and `input2`, under a defined limit `hidden_dim`. \n\nGiven the restrictions and the provided Python functions, the equivalent Python implementation using the `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_slice_with_length` functions is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```\n\nHere, we slice the input vectors to limit their length to `hidden_dim` using `vec_slice_with_length` function. Then, we perform element-wise multiplication using `vec_elemwise_mul` function. The result of such multiplication is equivalent to the output of the original C++ function.",
    "The given `transformer_part4` C++ function performs an element-wise multiplication between two vectors within a given range defined by the `hidden_dim`. To rewrite the function using the provided python functions, we can use `vec_elemwise_mul()` and `vec_slice_with_length()`. We first slice the first `hidden_dim` elements of both input lists, and then perform an element-wise multiplication on the resulting lists. \n\nHere is the converted function:\n\n```python\n\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n\n```",
    "From the `transformer_part4` function, it's clear that it's employing element-wise multiplication between two vectors for a specific range (hidden_dim). This functionality matches with the `vec_elemwise_mul` function from the provided functions. However, our `vec_elemwise_mul` function takes two vectors of equal length. Therefore, we need to slice the 'input1' and 'input2' vectors to the 'hidden_dim' length using the `vec_slice_with_length` function. Here is the equivalent Python function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```\n\nThis function first slices the two input vectors to the first `hidden_dim` elements. Then, these sliced vectors are multiplied element-wise. The result of the element-wise multiplication is returned as output.\n\nThe Python function is written under the constraints set in the problem statement (all expressions are inlined, and there is a single return statement), and thus matches the semantics of the given C++ function.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the provided functions and constraints would be `vec_elemwise_mul()` function. Here's the alternative implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim)` and `vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim)` are used to limit the inputs to the length of `hidden_dim` which is equivalent to the for loop in the C++ version.\n- `vec_elemwise_mul()` applies elementwise multiplication on the sliced input lists, equivalent to performing `input1[i] * input2[i]` in the C++ version. The results are returned in a new list which is equivalent to pushing back the results into `output` in the C++ version.",
    "The given function `transformer_part4` is performing an element-wise multiplication of the first `hidden_dim` elements of two vectors `input1` and `input2`. The equivalent Python function for the `transformer_part4` in C++ can be written using `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_slice_with_length` functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```\n\nIn the provided Python code, `vec_slice_with_length` is used to get the first `hidden_dim` elements of `input1` and `input2`, and then `vec_elemwise_mul` is used to perform element-wise multiplication of these two sliced vectors. The result of this multiplication is returned as the output of the `transformer_part4` function.\n\nThis Python function has the same operations and functionalities as the provided C++ function `transformer_part4` and hence, is semantically equivalent.",
    "The C++ function transformer_part4 takes two input vectors and a hidden_dim integer as arguments. It then multiplies each corresponding pair of elements at the same position of input1 and input2 up to the index position given by hidden_dim, and pushes the result into the output vector.\n\nAccording to the given instructions, the equivalent single return statement in Python would use the existing functions `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_slice_with_length` to achieve the same result. Hence, the corresponding Python function would be:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_slice_with_length(vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2), 0, hidden_dim)\n```\n\nHere, the function `vec_slice_with_length` is used to follow the behaviour of the loop in the C++ function, that is limiting the multiplication to the first `hidden_dim` elements.\n\nNote: vec_elemwise_mul() function multiplies corresponding elements from two lists and `vec_slice_with_length()` function is used to slice the list from start index to the length specified.",
    "The provided `transformer_part4` C++ function multiplies corresponding elements of `input1` and `input2` and retain the result till the `hidden_dim`. We have the function `vec_elemwise_mul` that does the element-wise multiplication of two arrays and another function `vec_slice_with_length` that can slice an array from 0 to `hidden_dim`. Combining these two functions, we can achieve the equivalent functionality as a single return statement.\n\nHere is how you can rewrite the above function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_slice_with_length(vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2), 0, hidden_dim)\n```\n\nThis single line of code is equivalent to the whole function provided. First, it uses `vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)` to multiply corresponding elements of `input1` and `input2` and then it uses `vec_slice_with_length( ..., 0, hidden_dim)` to slice array from index 0 till the `hidden_dim`.",
    "The equivalent Python rewrite of the C++ Code can be done with the help of the vec_elemwise_mul function as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```",
    "The Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the provided functions would be the `vec_elemwise_mul` function. It multiplies each corresponding element of the two vectors `input1` and `input2` which is equivalent to the C++ function `transformer_part4`.\n\nIn Python, you do not need the `hidden_dim` variable as the function will automatically stop at the end of the shortest input list. Here is the equivalent Python code:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(input1, input2)\n```",
    "The provided C++ function `transformer_part4` essentially performs element-wise multiplication of two input vectors `input1` and `input2` for the first `hidden_dim` elements. The elements in `output` are the products of the corresponding elements in `input1` and `input2`. This operation can be transformed using provided python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part4(input1: List[int], input2: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice_with_length(input1, 0, hidden_dim), vec_slice_with_length(input2, 0, hidden_dim))\n```\n\nThis Python function implements the same functionality as the provided C++ function. Here, `vec_slice_with_length` function is used to slice the first `hidden_dim` elements of both `input1` and `input2`, and then `vec_elemwise_mul` function is used to perform element-wise multiplication on both sliced inputs."
