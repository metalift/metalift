    "Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function `color_dodge_8` using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(y == 32, 32, x // (32 - y)))\n```\n\nThis function returns a matrix where each pixel value is computed based on the corresponding pixel values in the `base` and `active` matrices. If the pixel value in the `active` matrix is 32, the output pixel value is 32. Otherwise, the output pixel value is the pixel value from the `base` matrix divided by `(32 - the pixel value from the active matrix)`. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply this computation to each pair of corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` matrices. The `ite` function is used to implement the if-else conditional logic.",
    "The `color_dodge_8` function loops through each pixel in two 2D arrays (or images), `base` and `active`. If the pixel value in the `active` image is 32, it sets the corresponding pixel in the output image to 32. Otherwise, it divides the pixel value in the `base` image by 32 minus the pixel value in the `active` image. \n\nThis function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to iterate over each pair of corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` images, and the `ite` function to choose between the two possible output pixel values. \n\nHere is the equivalent Python function:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(y == 32, 32, x // (32 - y)))\n```\n\nThis function uses a lambda function to perform the operation on each pair of corresponding pixel values from the `base` and `active` images.\n\nNote: The division operation in the C++ function is integer division, which is equivalent to the // operator in Python.",
    "Based on the given C++ function `color_dodge_8` and the provided Python functions, you can rewrite the function in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, scalar_matrix_sub(32, active), lambda x, y: ite(y==32, 32, x//y))\n```\n\nIn the above function, `matrix_selection_two_args` iterates through each pixel of the images stored in 2D lists `base` and `active`. For each pair of corresponding pixels, it selects a value based on the condition inside the `ite` function. If the pixel in the `active` image is 32, it selects 32. Otherwise, it selects the pixel in the `base` image divided by `(32 - pixel in the active image)`. This is equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "The given `color_dodge_8` function in C++ can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda b, a: ite(a == 32, 32, b // (32 - a)))\n```\n\nThis function uses the function `matrix_selection_two_args` to iterate over elements of the `base` and `active` matrices together. For each pair of corresponding elements, it checks if the active matrix element is 32. If it is, the pixel value is set as 32. Otherwise, it sets the pixel value as the base matrix element divided by `(32 - active matrix element)`. This is done using the `ite` function inside a lambda function. The result of these operations is a new matrix that is equivalent to the one produced by the original C++ function.",

For each corresponding pair of elements, it uses `ite` to check if the value from the `active` matrix is 32. If it is, it returns 32, otherwise it divides the corresponding value from the `base` matrix by `32 - a` using `scalar_vec_div`.

For each pair of corresponding pixels in the two images, if the pixel in the `active` image is 32 (full intensity), the output pixel is also 32.

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to generate the output matrix. Inside `matrix_selection_two_args`, we use the `ite` function to decide each pixel value. If the value in the `active` matrix equals 32, then the output pixel is 32, otherwise, it is the value in the `base` matrix divided by the result of 32 subtracting the corresponding value in the `active` matrix.",

The applied function is a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns `32` if `y` is `32`, else it returns `x // (32 - y)`. This is equivalent to the pixel calculation in the original C++ function.",

It applies a color dodge operation on each pixel of two images represented by 2D matrices. If the pixel in the active layer is 32, it returns 32. Otherwise, it divides the pixel in the base layer by the difference between 32 and the pixel in the active layer. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply this operation on each pair of corresponding pixels in the two images."
