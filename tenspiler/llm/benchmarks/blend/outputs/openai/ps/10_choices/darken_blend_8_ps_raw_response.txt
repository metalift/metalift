The provided C++ function is a pixel-wise minimum operation between two matrices `base` and `active`. This operation is commonly used in image processing for blending operations, specifically the "darken blend" operation. Here, it operates on two 2D matrices and returns another 2D matrix where each pixel is the minimum of the corresponding pixels in the two input matrices.

We can implement this function in python using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, where the `select_two_args_arg` is a function that returns the minimum of two arguments.

```python
from typing import List
from operator import min

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
This python function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. It iterates over corresponding elements in two matrices and applies the provided function (which in this case is the `min` function) to each pair of elements. The result is a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrices.
The `darken_blend_8` function performs an element-wise minimum operation on two matrices. Thus, it can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with the `min` function passed as the `select_two_args_arg` parameter. Here is the rewritten function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This Python function behaves exactly like the provided C++ function. For each pair of corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices, it chooses the smaller one (i.e., it performs the min operation). The result is a new matrix that contains the result of this operation for all pairs of elements.
The given `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(
        base, active, lambda x, y: x if x < y else y
    )
```
This function uses the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` which takes two input matrices and a function operating on two arguments. The lambda function inside takes two arguments and returns the smaller one, mimicking the behaviour of the original C++ function.
You can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function which takes two matrices and a function that applies elementwise on these two matrices. The function to be passed here is the minimum function, which returns the smaller of the two elements.

So, the rewritten function can be written as:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
Here, `min` is a built-in Python function that returns the minimum of the input arguments.
The provided C++ function "darken_blend_8" applies a 'darken blend' operation on two matrices "base" and "active". It creates a resultant matrix such that each element in the resultant matrix is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the two input matrices.

The equivalent Python function using the provided functions and constants can be written as a single return statement. The function "matrix_selection_two_args" can be used to go through both matrices simultaneously and apply a function that selects the smaller of the two corresponding elements. In Python, the "min" function can be used to get the minimum of two numbers. Therefore, the equivalent Python function is:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function. It uses the provided functions and follows the given instructions.
The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors, `base` and `active`, and creates a new 2D vector, `out`. It iterates over each element in `base` and `active` and for each pair of corresponding elements, it adds the smaller one to `out`.

Here is the Python equivalent using the provided functions:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function performs element-wise operation on two matrices with the provided function. In this case, the `min` function is used which returns the smaller of two elements. This is equivalent to the functionality of the `darken_blend_8` function.
Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function `darken_blend_8` using only the provided functions:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
This function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which applies a given function (in this case, `min`) to corresponding elements in two matrices. This is equivalent to selecting the darker pixel in the `darken_blend_8` C++ function.
The equivalent Python function using the given defined functions would be:

```python
from typing import List

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to compare each pixel of the `base` and `active` image. The `min` function is used as the selection argument to choose the smaller value between the base and active pixel, effectively recreating the darken blend effect of the original C++ function.
The given `darken_blend_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
Here, `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply the `min` function element-wise on the 'base' and 'active' matrices. This Python function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function.
The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors (or matrices) `base` and `active` and returns a new 2D vector `out` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`.

This function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functional programming functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to select the minimum value from each pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`.

The `min` function is passed as the third argument to `matrix_selection_two_args` to specify that the minimum value should be selected from each pair.
The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
This function is using the `matrix_selection_two_args` defined function that takes two matrices and a function that operate on two arguments. Here, we pass the `min` function of Python as the third argument, which will return the minimum value between the base and active matrices, which is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function.
Here is the python equivalent of the C++ function using the defined functions. The `darken_blend_8` function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, with a custom selection function that chooses the minimum of two inputs.

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```
You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function provided. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a given function to each pair of corresponding elements from two matrices.

In this case, we want to apply the `min` function, which will select the smaller of the two elements. This corresponds to the logic in the `if-else` statement in the original `darken_blend_8` function.

The rewritten function would look like this:

```python
from typing import List

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This version of `darken_blend_8` is a single return statement that uses only the provided functions and constants, as required. It's also more concise and arguably more readable than the original version, especially for someone familiar with functional programming.
In Python, you can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function. This function takes two matrices and a function to perform element-wise operation on these matrices. For the function to perform the operation, you can use Python's built-in `min` function which returns the minimum of two values.

Here's how you can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function will return a new matrix where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` matrices, which is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.
In Python, the equivalent function to the provided C++ `darken_blend_8` function can be written as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This Python function uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the Python built-in `min` function to corresponding elements of the `base` and `active` matrices. This is equivalent to selecting the smaller of the corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices, which is what the C++ function does. The result is a new matrix of the same size where each element is the smaller of the corresponding elements from the `base` and `active` matrices.
The given `darken_blend_8` C++ function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This Python function works the same way as the original C++ function. It takes two matrices (2D lists) as input and returns a new matrix. For each corresponding pair of elements in the two input matrices, it selects the smaller one (because `min` function is passed as the selection criterion) and puts it in the corresponding position in the output matrix. This process is equivalent to the pixel-by-pixel "darken blend" operation performed by the original C++ function.
You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function in a single return statement using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This function applies a binary selection function to each pair of corresponding elements in two matrices.

In this case, the binary selection function should be the `min` function, which selects the smaller of two values. This is equivalent to the condition in the provided `darken_blend_8` function, which selects the smaller of `base[row][col]` and `active[row][col]`.

Here is the equivalent Python function:

```python
from typing import List

def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function takes as input two matrices of integers `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix. Each cell in the output matrix is the minimum of the corresponding cells in the input matrices.
You can rewrite the `darken_blend_8` function using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which takes two matrices and applies a function to each corresponding pair of elements. In Python, you would use the built-in `min` function to get the minimum value of each pair, which produces the same result as the `if`-`else` statement in the original function. Here is the rewritten function:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

This function works by applying `min` to each pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix with the results. This is equivalent to choosing the smaller of the two values for each pair, which is what the original `darken_blend_8` function does.
The `darken_blend_8` C++ function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(
        base,
        active,
        lambda x, y: x if x < y else y
    )
```

The provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` iterates over two matrices element-wise and calls the provided lambda function on each pair of elements in the matrices. This achieves the same result as the original C++ function, which selects the minimum of each pair of corresponding pixels in the base and active images.
The given C++ function `darken_blend_8` takes in two 2D matrices `base` and `active`, and returns a new matrix where each element is the minimum value of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. This function can be rewritten in python using the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function and the built-in `min` function as follows:

```python
def darken_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)
```

The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies a specified binary function (in this case, `min`) to each pair of corresponding elements in two matrices. This is exactly what the original C++ function is doing, so this python function is semantically equivalent to the original C++. The `min` function is used to select the smaller of the two pixel values.
