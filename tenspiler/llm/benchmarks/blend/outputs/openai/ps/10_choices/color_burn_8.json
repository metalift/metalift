    "The given `test` function can be rewritten as a single return statement using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, \n        lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: ite(active_pixel == 0, 32, \n        32 - scalar_vec_div(32 - base_pixel, active_pixel)))\n```\nThis Python function `color_burn_8` performs the same operation as the given C++ function. It uses the provided functions `matrix_selection_two_args` to iterate over the given matrices, and `ite` to implement the conditional logic. The `scalar_vec_div` function is used to perform the division operation in the else part of the condition. Note that matrix and vector operations are element-wise.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the provided defined functions can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        scalar_matrix_div(32, base),\n        active,\n        lambda base_pix, active_pix: ite(active_pix == 0, 32, 32 - base_pix // active_pix)\n    )\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to iterate over each corresponding pixel in the `base` and `active` matrices. If the pixel from the `active` matrix is 0, it returns 32, otherwise it computes the color burn effect by subtracting the division of the pixel from the `base` matrix by the pixel from the `active` matrix from 32. This is equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "The given `color_burn_8` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_scalar_add(32, matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_scalar_sub(32, base), active)),\n        matrix_scalar_mul(32, active),\n        lambda base, active: ite(active == 0, 32, base)\n    )\n```\n\nThis program uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply a function to corresponding elements of the `base` and `active` matrices. The function is defined using a lambda expression, which uses the `ite` function to select between two values depending on whether the `active` pixel is zero. The two possible values are calculated using the provided matrix arithmetic functions, and are equivalent to the calculations performed in the original C++ function.",
    "The equivalent Python code for the given C++ code using the provided functions is:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda pixel_base, pixel_active: ite(pixel_active == 0, 32, 32 - (32 - pixel_base) // pixel_active))\n```\nThis Python code does the same thing as the C++ code. It applies the color burn operation on a 2D array of pixels. The 2D array is treated as a matrix and the operation is applied to each pixel. If the pixel of the active image is 0, the output pixel is set to 32. Otherwise, the output pixel is computed by taking the base pixel, subtracting it from 32, dividing the result by the active pixel, and subtracting this from 32. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply this operation to each pair of corresponding pixels in the base and active images. The `ite` function is used to handle the conditional logic.",
    "The original function `color_burn_8` in C++ applies color burning effect on a 2D matrix representing an image. Each element in the matrix represents a pixel value. The color burning effect is applied based on the corresponding pixel value in another active matrix. \n\nIn Python, we can replace the nested for loops by using list comprehension and the provided higher-order functions. The C++ function can be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda x, y: ite(y == 0, 32, 32 - (32 - x) // y))\n```\n\nThe function `matrix_selection_two_args` replaces the nested for loop in C++. It applies a function (the third argument) element-wise to two matrices. The function to apply is a lambda function that checks if the pixel in the active matrix is zero. If it is, it returns 32 (which is the maximum pixel value). Otherwise, it applies the color burn effect. This effect is achieved by subtracting from 32 the result of integer division of `32 - base[row][col]` by `active[row][col]`. The `ite` function is used to replace the if-else statement in the original C++ code. It returns the second argument if the condition (first argument) is true, and the third argument otherwise.",
    "The `color_burn_8` function applies the \"Color Burn\" effect to a given base image using the corresponding pixel values from an active image. For each pixel, it calculates the new pixel value depending on whether the corresponding pixel in the active image is zero or not. If it is zero, the new pixel value is 32 (maximum possible value for an 8-bit color channel), otherwise it is calculated as `32 - (32 - base[row][col]) / active[row][col]`.\n\nHere's the Python version of the function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_scalar_add(32, base),\n        ite(active == 0, 32, scalar_matrix_div(32 - base, active)),\n        lambda a, b: a - b\n    )\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the operation to each pair of corresponding pixels in the base and active images. The `matrix_scalar_add` function is used to add 32 to each pixel in the base image. The `ite` function is used to check whether each pixel in the active image is zero or not, and then either returns 32 or calculates the new pixel value as described above. The `scalar_matrix_div` function is used to divide the difference between 32 and each pixel in the base image by the corresponding pixel in the active image. Finally, the lambda function is used to subtract the second calculated value from the first calculated value to get the final pixel value for the output image.",
    "Using the provided functions, the C++ function can be translated into a Python function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active,\n                                     lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: ite(active_pixel == 0,\n                                                                           32,\n                                                                           32 - (32 - base_pixel) // active_pixel))\n```",
    "The `color_burn_8` function is essentially performing element-wise operation on two matrices. It checks each element of the `active` matrix, if the element is 0 then it assigns 32 to the corresponding position in the output matrix, else it performs the operation `32 - (32 - base[row][col]) / active[row][col]` and assigns the result to the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nThe operation can be rewritten using provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda base, active: ite(active == 0, 32, 32 - (32 - base) // active))\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n* `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to perform element-wise operation on two matrices.\n* `lambda base, active: ite(active == 0, 32, 32 - (32 - base) // active)` is the element-wise operation we want to perform. `ite` is a ternary operator that takes a condition and two values, it returns the second value if the condition is true, else it returns the third value.",
