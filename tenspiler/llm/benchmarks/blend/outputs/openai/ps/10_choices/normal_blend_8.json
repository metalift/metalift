    "You can rewrite the `normal_blend_8` function using the provided Python functions as follows. We will be using the functions `vec_scalar_mul`, `vec_elemwise_mul` and `vec_elemwise_add` to multiply with scalar and add vectors elementwise:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThis Python function does the same thing as the C++ function:\n\n- It multiplies each element of the `active` vector by `opacity` and creates a new vector.\n- Then, it multiplies each element of the `base` vector by `(32 - opacity)` and creates another new vector.\n- Finally, it adds the elements of the two new vectors element-by-element and returns the resulting vector.",
    "The C++ function `normal_blend_8` takes three arguments: two vectors `base` and `active`, and an integer `opacity`. It then uses a loop to run through all the elements in the `base` vector, carrying out a specific computation on each, and pushing the result into the `out` vector. The computation involves multiplying the `opacity` with elements in the `active` vector and `32 - opacity` with elements in the `base` vector, finally adding these two products together.\n\nSince the Python functions you provided do not include looping or pushing elements into a list, we need to substitute these with their equivalents based on the functions provided.\n\nThe use of `for` loop can be substituted using operations on lists and the specific calculations can be substituted by using the functions `vec_scalar_mul` and `vec_elemwise_add`. Following this approach, we can rewrite the function as shown below. \n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return_var = vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n    return return_var\n```\nThis function takes `base`, `active` and `opacity` as inputs just like the original C++ function and performs the same set of operations as the original function using the Python functions provided. `vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)` replaces the operation `opacity * active[i]` and `vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base)` replaces `(32 - opacity) * base[i]`. These are elements-wise multiplications. Finally, the elements-wise addition is performed on the resulting lists replacing `out.push_back(opacity * active[i] + (32 - opacity) * base[i]);` by `vec_elemwise_add()`. \n\nSo the python function `normal_blend_8` is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function and fulfills the requirements you specified in your instruction.",
    "Below is the equivalent Python function of the provided C++ function, using functions from the provided set:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```",
    "Here is the rewritten Python function using provided functions:\n\n```python\n\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThis function does the same as the C++ function; for each element in the list it multiplies the opacity with the corresponding element in 'active', then multiplies 32 minus opacity with the corresponding element in 'base'. Finally, it adds those two results together. The entire operation is done element-wise on the input vectors 'base' and 'active'.",
    "Your required transformation of the C++ code to Python using the provided functions could be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n``` \n\nIn this transformation, we use `vec_scalar_mul` functions to perform the multiplication of each element in vectors with scalar value, similar to how `opacity * active[i]` and `(32 - opacity) * base[i]` work in the original C++ code. Then `vec_elemwise_add` is used to perform the addition of the aforementioned results which are also vectorized - equivalent to `out.push_back(...)`. This is done by treating scalar multiplication and addition as an element-wise operation on vectors. \n\nAlso, it's important to notice - this Python equivalent function assumes that both 'base' and 'active' lists are of the same size, if it isn't the case, an error will occur.\n",
    "Here is the rewritten function using only the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n  return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nIn C++ function `normal_blend_8`, for each index `i` of vector base and active, we are calculating `opacity * active[i] + (32 - opacity) * base[i]` and pushing it to the `out` vector.\n\nThis operation is equivalent to element-wise multiplication of `active` with `opacity` and `base` with `(32 - opacity)`, and then element-wise addition of the two result vectors. We can achieve this using provided functions `vec_scalar_mul()` and `vec_elemwise_add()`.",
    "The provided C++ function `normal_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using functions listed as below:\n# Python Function\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\nThis function takes advantage of the ability to perform element-wise operations on two equivalent-sized vectors (`base` and `active` in this case). It multiplies each element in `active` vector with opacity and each element in `base` vector with `32 - opacity`. It then adds these two vectors element-wise to form the final output. This Python function is semantically equivalent to the provided C++ function, obeying the requirement to map closely to the original function's functionality.",
    "The Python equivalent of the function `normal_blend_8` using list comprehensions and the provided helper functions could be:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add( vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base) )\n```\nThis function uses the provided helper function `vec_elemwise_add` to perform element-wise addition and `vec_scalar_mul` to perform multiplication of each vector with a scalar. At the end, it multiplies the `active` list by `opacity` and the `base` list by `32 - opacity`, then adds these two lists element-wise.",
    "The equivalent Python function could be implemented using just a single line as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThis Python function uses provided functions `vec_scalar_mul` (equivalent of multiplication operation 'opacity * active[i]' or '(32 - opacity) * base[i]' in C++) and `vec_elemwise_add` (equivalent of adding elements together 'opacity * active[i] + (32 - opacity) * base[i]' for all i in C++) to produce a semantically equivalent program. This implementation utilizes Python built-in list and function manipulation features and does not use any loops, intermediate variables, or functions other than ones provided.",
    "Based on given rules and using the provided functions, the equivalent function for `normal_blend_8` in Python will be:\n\n``` Python\ndef normal_blend_8(base: List[int], active: List[int], opacity: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\nThe test function is essentially element-wise addition of two vectors. Elements of the first vector are the result of multiplying all elements of the 'active' vector with opacity. Elements of the second vector are the result of multiplying all elements of the 'base' vector with '32 - opacity'. This is represented by the above python function."
