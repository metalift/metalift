    "Given C++ function performs element-wise multiplication of two matrices and then divides each element by 255. To rewrite this in Python using the set of provided functions, we will use the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to multiply the matrices element-wise, then `matrix_scalar_div` to divide each resulting element by 255.\n\nThe rewritten function in Python should look like this:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis Python function, `multiply_blend_8`, would perform the same operation as the given C++ `multiply_blend_8` function.",
    "The `multiply_blend_8` function can be written in Python using the set of defined functions as following:\n```\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), vec_scalar_mul(255, matrix_scalar_mul(1, base)))\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIt is clear from the problem description that `multiply_blend_8` function is performing element-wise multiplication of the `base` and `active` matrices and then dividing all the elements of the resultant matrix by `255`, to match it with the value of an 8 bits representation.\n\nUsing `matrix_elemwise_mul`, we can perform the initial multiplication operation. The resultant matrix is then divided by `255` using `matrix_elemwise_div`. \n\nBut note that `matrix_elemwise_div` performs element-wise division of two matrices, so we need to create a matrix of equal size with `255` as elements. That is achieved by `vec_scalar_mul(255, matrix_scalar_mul(1, base))`. `matrix_scalar_mul(1, base)` will create a matrix with the same value as `base`, and `vec_scalar_mul(255, ...)` will replace all values of the base matrix with `255`, creating the desired matrix to divide by.\n\nRemember, we inline the expressions and operations, as required.",
    "The provided C++ function `multiply_blend_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` as inputs and returns another 2D vector `out` such that for each position (i, j), the value in `out` is the multiplication of the corresponding values in `base` and `active` divided by 255.\n\nWe can convert this C++ function to Python using the provided functions using the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to multiply corresponding values and then the `matrix_scalar_div` function to divide each value by 255. After that, we need to convert all results to integers, for this, we can use `matrix_map` function with a lambda function to convert floats to integers.\n\nHere is a re-write of the C++ function using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_map(matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)), lambda x: int(x))\n```\n\nThis function first multiplies the corresponding values in the two matrices using `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)`. It then divides each result by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))`. Finally, it uses `matrix_map` function with a lambda function to convert floats to integers.",
    "Here is a Python equivalent function of the given C++ function using provided functions:\n```python\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(\n             matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active),\n             matrix_scalar_mul(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n           )\n```\nThis function first performs elementwise multiplication of base and active matrices using `matrix_elemwise_mul`. The result is then divided elementwise by 255 using `matrix_elemwise_div` and `matrix_scalar_mul`.",
    "The given `multiply_blend_8` function in C++ performs element-wise multiplication of a `base` and `active` 2D matrix and then divides each element by 255. \n\nThe equivalent Python function using the provided functions will be:\n\n```python\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), vec_scalar_div(255, base))\n\n```\n\nThe Python function `multiply_blend_8` takes the arguments `base` and `active` which are the 2D matrices, equivalent to the `base` and `active`. Then it returns a 2D matrix that is a result of element-wise division of the element-wise multiplication of base and active with 255. The division is achieved by scaling down the base matrix with `255` using `vec_scalar_div(255, base)`, and using this result for the division.\n\nNotice that we are using `vec_scalar_div` instead of `matrix_scalar_div` because the provided matrix division function seems to be performing integer division in python, which would result in a loss of information for any values that are not divisible by the divisor.",
    "Given the constraints and the list of available functions, we must use the `matrix_elemwise_mul` method to perform the multiplication between the `base` and `active` matrices. However, since we also want to divide each resulting pixel by 255, we need to `map` each value of the resulting matrix to their quotient when divided by 255.\n\nHere is the equivalent python function using the provided functions:\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), matrix_scalar_mul(255, base))\n```\nNote: This function assumes the `/` operator in the C++ code performs integer division in the range of 0 to 255 (uint8). If float division is needed, the provided functions do not currently support it, or we should swap out `matrix_elemwise_div` with another equivalent function that performs float division.",
    "The C++ function can be rewritten using list comprehension in Python, with the provided functions. We will use the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to multiply the corresponding elements of the matrices, and `matrix_scalar_div` function to divide the result by 255. \n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis function performs exactly the same operations as the given C++ function. For each pair of corresponding pixels in the two images, it multiplies the pixel values together and then divides the result by 255. The output is a new image where the pixel values are the result of this operation.",
    "Here's your original C++ function rewritten in Python using the provided functions. The function `matrix_elemwise_mul` is used to multiply the elements of the two matrices, and then the result is divided by `255` using `vec_map` and `matrix_scalar_div`:\n\n```python\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, vec_map(\n        matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), \n        lambda x: x // 255\n    ))\n```\n\nIn this rewritten function, `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` performs element-wise multiplication on the `base` and `active` matrices, while `vec_map` is used to perform integer division of all the product results by `255`.\n \nSubsequently, `matrix_scalar_div` is used to account for the `/255` operation in your original C++ code.",
    "To rewrite the given `multiply_blend_8` C++ function using the provided Python functions while following the instructions, you can write a function, `multiply_blend_8`, which only contains a single line that calls the provided function `matrix_elemwise_div`. This function is used to divide a matrix by a scalar.\n\nIn this case, the given C++ function multiplies the corresponding elements of the `base` and `active` matrices, then divides each product by 255. This operation can be represented as element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` matrices (done by `matrix_elemwise_mul` function), followed by division of each element of the result by 255 (done by `matrix_scalar_div` function).\n\nHere's the Python equivalent of the test function with provided functions.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis Python function accepts two lists of lists for `base` and `active`, and returns their multiplied blend which is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "Here is rewritten `multiply_blend_8` function in Python.\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, base))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function to multiply `base` matrix with `active` matrix element-wise. Then the `matrix_elemwise_div` function is used to divide the result with `matrix_scalar_div(255, base)` which results in division of each element of the product matrix by `255`. This is equivalent to how the multiplication and division operation is being done in original function. Since the original function allows integer division, outer matrix division is used instead of inner scalar division.\n\nNote: Here, it is assumed that the functions can handle the requirement of `uint8_t` (unsigned 8-bit integer) as done in the original C++ function. Also, it is assumed that divisions lead to integer results as the original function is implemented with integer division ( / operator), which is similar to floor division in Python ( // operator).  \n"
