    "We can rewrite the provided C++ function `transformer_part3` in Python using the provided functions. The equivalent Python function will be expressed as a single return statement.\n\nThe function `transformer_part3` takes a vector (or list) of integers and a hidden dimension as input. It then multiplies each element of the input vector by `(1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` and returns a resulting vector. \n\nHere, `integer_exp` is a function that returns the input as is, which means it doesn't really affect the expression and we can simplify `(1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` to `1 / (1+ (-input[i]))`. \n\nSince Python uses '/' for floating point division and '//' for integer division, our division will actually be integer division. So, the expression `1 / (1+ (-input[i]))` will always return 0 for all `input[i] >= 1`, and will crash for `input[i] = -1` as we'll be dividing by zero. So we'll need to take care of these edge cases.\n\nLet's write this as the Python function:\n\n```\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: 0 if x >= 1 else (1 // (1 - x) if x != -1 else None))\n```\n\nThis Python function uses list slicing to take the first `hidden_dim` elements of `input`, and the `vec_map` function applies a lambda function to each element of the input list. The lambda function multiplies the input element with `1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i]))`. If the computed value is not an integer, the lambda function will return `None`, otherwise it will return the computed integer.\n\nI recommend using floating point arithmetic if you need more precise results, but that wasn't an option based on our constraints.\n",
    "Here is how you could rewrite the `transformer_part3` function using the provided python functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef integer_exp(x):\n    return x\n\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_map(\n        vec_slice_with_length(input, 0, hidden_dim),\n        lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))),\n    )\n```\nIn this rewritten function, `vec_slice_with_length` is used to match the `for` loop's iteration over `hidden_dim` elements from the `input` list. `vec_map` is then used with a lambda function to apply the same operations as the C++ version does inside of its loop body, substituting the `integer_exp` and arithmetic operations. This accomplishes the same thing as the loop in the original `transformer_part3` function without using a `for` loop.",
    "Here is the rewritten Python code function using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef integer_exp(x: int) -> int:\n    return x\n\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    map_func = lambda i: i * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - i)))\n    output = vec_map(vec_slice_with_length(input, 0, hidden_dim), map_func)\n    return output\n```\n\nIn this transformation, we firstly defined a lambda function `map_func` that transforms an individual element of the list, as per the instructions in the body of the for loop from your C++ function. After that, the input list is sliced to get only the `hidden_dim` first elements, which are then mapped using `vec_map` with the previously defined `map_func`. This operation is equivalent to your for loop, but makes use of the provided vector mapping function. \n\nNote: the list slicing operation in Python is inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. Hence, `vec_slice_with_length(input, 0, hidden_dim)` gives a subsequence of `input` from index 0 to index `hidden_dim - 1`, inclusive, exactly as in the original C++ code.",
    "The provided C++ function \"transformer_part3\" applies a transformation on each element of the input vector up to a certain limit determined by \"hidden_dim\". The transformation is described by the expression `input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))`. The computed value is then added to the end of the output vector. This transformation is essentially applying the sigmoid function `.sigmoid(i) -> .1 / (1 + e^(-i))` on each element and multiplying the original element with this computed value. We can do this using the provided Python functions.\n\n# Python Rewrite\nOur task is to rewrite the C++ function using the provided Python functions. We can use the provided function `vec_map()` to apply an operation to each element of a list. We note that the operation `input[i] * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - input[i])))` can't be directly translated to Python because the math library's `exp()` function takes a floating-point number as the input, however the solve does not specify whether the inputs are integers or floating point numbers. Here we assume we can use `math.exp(-i)` instead of integer_exp, the operation in python becomes `input[i] * (1 / (1 + math.exp(-input[i])))`.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_map(input[:hidden_dim], lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))))\n```\nNote: `input[:hidden_dim]` is Python's way of slicing a list from the start up to `hidden_dim`. This corresponds to the loop's range in the original C++ code. \nThe lambda function in `vec_map()` takes each element `x` of the input list and applies the transformation. \n\nPlease remember that Python's `vec_map()` might not be as efficient as C++'s loop due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This Python function gives us an exact equivalent to the provided C++ function according to the task's instructions but might not necessarily perform as efficiently on large data.",
    "The given `test` C++ function can be rewritten in Python as follows, making use of provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_map(vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim), lambda x: x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x))))\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe given `test` function in C++ involves iterating over the first `hidden_dim` elements of `input` vector, performing a mathematical operation on each element, and then storing the results in `output` vector. Since we are not allowed to use explicit for-loops for rewriting the function, we can take advantage of the `vec_map` function, which applies a given function argument on each element of a list. We also use the `vec_slice` function to select the first `hidden_dim` elements from the input list.\n\nIn the lambda function we pass to `vec_map`, we emulate the mathematical operation carried out on each element in the for-loop of the `test` function. In this case, the operation is `x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))`. Note that the lambda function implicitly loops over the elements of the input list passed to `vec_map`, so this method of applying the operation adheres to the instructions of no explicit looping.",
    "You can rewrite the C++ function `transformer_part3` using the provided Python functions like this\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_slice_with_length(vec_elemwise_mul(input, vec_map(input, lambda x: 1 / (1 + math.exp(0 - x)))), 0, hidden_dim)\n```\n\nThis Python function first applies the `integer_exp` function to each element in `input` using the `vec_map` function, then multiplies the original `input` with the result of `vec_map` operation element-wise using the `vec_elemwise_mul` function, and finally slices the result up to `hidden_dim` using the `vec_slice_with_length` function. Note that `math.exp` is used to represent the `integer_exp` function from the original C++ code.",
    "The corresponding Python code for the `transformer_part3` function using the provided functions is as shown below.\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return reduce_sum(vec_elemwise_mul(input[0:hidden_dim], vec_scalar_div(1, vec_map(vec_scalar_add(1, vec_elemwise_mul(vec_scalar_mul(-1, input[0:hidden_dim]), [integer_exp]*hidden_dim)), integer_exp))))\n```\nIn the above Python function, the `vec_elemwise_mul` function is used to replace the element-wise multiplication operation, the `vec_scalar_mul` function is used to replace the scalar multiplication operation, and the `vec_map` function is used to apply the `integer_exp` function to each element in the list. Similarly, the `vec_scalar_add` and `vec_scalar_dup` functions are used to perform the element-wise addition and division operations, respectively. The `reduce_sum` function is used at the end to add up all the elements in the result. The slicing operation in the C++ function is replaced by directly selecting the part of the list needed using the Python slicing syntax (`input[0:hidden_dim]`). Finally, the `integer_exp` function just returns the input value as it is, since the exponent function is 1 in the C++ code.",
    "The function `transformer_part3` in C++ is equivalent to one that combines slicing a list, applying element-wise multiplication on a list and a scalar derived from an integral exponential function. We can rewrite it utilizing the given custom Python functions.\n\nHere's the equivalent Python function just using a return statement:\n\n```python\ndef transformer_part3(input: List[int], hidden_dim: int) -> List[int]:\n    return vec_elemwise_mul(vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim), vec_map([(1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - i))) for i in vec_slice(input, 0, hidden_dim)])) \n```\n\nNote:\nIn this function:\n1. The expression inside `vec_map` is used to generate a list from a map operation (element-wise operation), it applies the formula `(1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - i)))` to each element in the sliced list to create a new list.\n2. `vec_elemwise_mul` is used to multiply the sliced list and the newly generated list element-wise.\n3. The `vec_slice` function is used to slice the input list from the 0th-index up to the `hidden_dim` index. The slicing is done twice to get two identical lists to perform element-wise multiplication.\n4. The `integer_exp` function is not defined in the prompt but is assumed to be a user-defined function that performs integer exponentiation. It is actually an identity function, i.e. `integer_exp(x) = x` and is not being used in exponentiation in the formula, hence its actual implementation doesn't affect the result.",

We use `vec_map` to apply a given function to each element of the input vector. The lambda function represents the operation `x * (1 / (1 + integer_exp(0 - x)))`  inside the loop. Please note that `integer_exp` is a placeholder function and it should be replaced with an actual implementation as per your needs.",
