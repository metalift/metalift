    "Here is the equivalent python function using the provided functional definitions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n\n    # This is a python equivalent of the lambda function used in C++ code\n    def select_two_args_arg(a, b):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return b if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else a\n\n    # Now, we will use the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` \n    # to apply the significant logic present in `test` function\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThe function `matrix_selection_two_args` is functionally equivalent to the nested for loop in the C++ function. It applies the function `select_two_args_arg` to each element of the `base` and `active` matrices, which corresponds to choosing the pixel from `active` or `base` based on the opacity and a random value."
