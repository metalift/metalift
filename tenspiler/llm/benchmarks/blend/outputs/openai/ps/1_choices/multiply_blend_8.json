    "The given C++ function `multiply_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python by using the defined function `matrix_elemwise_mul`. However, as you need to multiply each pixel and then divided by 32, which is not available in the current defined functions,  you need to create a new function `multiply_and_divide` and use it inside `matrix_selection_two_args`.\n\n```python\ndef multiply_and_divide(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    return (base_pixel * active_pixel) // 32\n\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, multiply_and_divide)\n\n```\nThis Python code does the same operation as your given C++ function. It takes two input matrices `base` and `active`. Inside `multiply_blend_8`, it calls the function `matrix_selection_two_args` by passing these matrices and a function `multiply_and_divide` which does the operation of multiplying two pixels and dividing by 32."
