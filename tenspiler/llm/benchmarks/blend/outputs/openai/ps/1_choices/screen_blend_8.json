    "Here is the equivalent code in Python using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    n = len(base)\n    m = len(base[0])\n    \n    def blend(x, y):\n        return x + y - (x * y) // 255\n\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend)\n    return out\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe provided C++ function iterates through every element (or pixel) of base and active 2d vectors and updates the value using a blend formula 'base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255'.\n\nIn Python, we can achieve this by using the selection_two_args function inside matrix_selection_two_args. This essentially applies the blend operation on each corresponding pair of elements in the two matrices.\n\nNote: The provided Python function screen_blend_8 behaves exactly like the C++ function and results in a matrix which is the pixel-by-pixel screen blend of input matrices `base` and `active`. The integer division by 255 in the formula simulates the effect of a screen blend mode in digital painting where the underlying algorithm often operates in the 8-bits-per-channel color space. This will produce lighter colors for non-black colors of the active layer, and color values will never be decreased, resembling the effect achieved by projecting multiple photographic slides on top of each other."
