    "The \"color_burn_8\" C++ function, in Python, with leveraging provided functions, would look as follows:\n\nFirst, you need to instantiate the function for operations dealing specifically with two integers. The map_int_to_int function deals with the concept of a pixel modification, mimicking your C++ function.\n\n```Python\ndef pixel_mod(base,active):\n    if active == 0:\n        return 32\n    else:\n        return 32 - (32 - base) // active\n```\n\nNext you would instantiate the matrix_selection_two_args function, passing the newly defined pixel_mod as the last input.\n\n```Python\ndef color_burn_8(base,active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_mod)\n```\n\nThe logic of the color_burn_8 function remains the same as in your C++ code. It's responsible for applying the modifications to every pixel in the 2D matrix (image). If active pixel is 0, it returns 32; otherwise, it performs a calculation involving both base and active pixel.\n\nThe mathematical operation part is handled by pixel_mod function while interating over elements of matrix is performed by matrix_selection_two_args. This function iterates over corresponding elements of two same-sized matrices, applying a binary operation to each pair of elements.\n\nThis code is the pythonic and more optimized version of your C++ function using a function-based approach. All these functions are now reusable in different contexts with similar data and operations."
