    "The C++ function simply works on 2D vector, iterating every pair of values and asking if the condition is met then performing an operation on the value pair. We can reproduce this function in Python using the defined helpers like so:\n\n```\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    def pixel_operation(x):\n        return (2*x + x - 2*x*x // 32 - 32) if x >= 128 else (2 * x * x // 32)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_operation)\n```\nSo the `overlay_blend_8` function works by using a helper function `matrix_selection_two_args` that simply performs an operation on two given 2D vectors. The operation itself is defined by the `pixel_operation` function given that it checks a condition on every corresponding pair from the two matrices and it either returns the pair value or performs an operation on it. \n\nIn the end, `overlay_blend_8` function returns a 2D vector with every pair value either replaced or operated upon if the condition is met."
