    "The original C++ function `dissolve_blend_8`, uses an `opacity` level to blend two `2D` arrays (the `base` and `active`). It evaluates at each position whether a random value is less than the `opacity`. If true, the pixel from the `active` is chosen; otherwise, the `base` pixel is used.\n\nTo rewrite this function using the set of provided Python functions, I would use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function defined in your list, with a special input argument (`select_two_args_arg`). This requires us to define a mapping first as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_const):\n    def map_int_to_int(x):\n        return ((rand_const % 100) + 1) // 100\n\n    def select_two_args_arg(x, y):\n        rand_val = map_int_to_int(rand_const)\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return y\n        else:\n            return x\n    \n    output = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n    return output\n```\n\nThis Python function is equivalent to your C++ function and should give the same results when the parameters are converted appropriately. The reason we could not directly use provided functions without making a new function is due to the specific logics for pixel choosing in the `dissolve_blend_8` function. As the pre-defined functions don't provide a direct means to transfer those logics, we were required to define `select_two_args_arg`.\nThe given function `map_int_to_int` maps a `rand_const` to a random number (within `0` and `1`), approximating the rand_val in the C++ function. The `select_two_args_arg` applies the decision logic of original C++ code."
