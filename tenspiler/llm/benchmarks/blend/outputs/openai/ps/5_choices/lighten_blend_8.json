    "The function `lighten_blend_8` can be translated into Python using the given set of defined functions like this:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def max_or_active(a, b):\n        if a < b:\n            return b\n        else:\n            return a\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max_or_active)\n```\nHere the `max_or_active` function is defined to replace the original if-else structure from the C++ code. The Python function `matrix_selection_two_args` is then used to apply `max_or_active` to corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` images, creating the equivalent function in Python.",
    "Here is how the given C++ function can be rewritten using the python functions provided above. The *lighten_blend_8* algorithm essentially selects the greater of the base and active pixel at each location. This operation is equivalent to element-wise maximum operation between two matrices. \n\nIn Python, this can be achieved with the built-in max function which is then applied element-wise onto the two matrices.\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Use the provided 'max' function in the 'selection_two_args' method\n    # to perform an element-wise maximum operation between two matrices.\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nNote: The built-in python max function can be used for the 'select_two_args_arg' parameter. If an equivalent to this max function is available in the set of defined functions provided, use that instead. This will directly compare corresponding elements from each matrix, determine the maximum and produce a new matrix that storing all these maximum values. This is effectively the same operation as the original C++ version but in a more concise and efficient manner.\n\nDetail: In the provided C++ function, it loops through the matrices (image pixels) and pushes the maximum pixel value (brightness) from either the 'base' or 'active' image to form the resulting image. So, semantically it's comparing the corresponding pixels in two images and taking the one with greater brightness. This operation in Python, by comparison, is very concise and expressive. This leverages the powerful capabilities of high-level programming languages.",
    "The given `lighten_blend_8` C++ function can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe `lighten_blend_8` C++ function essentially picks the maximum between the corresponding elements of the base and active matrices. This is equivalent to applying the `max` function to the corresponding elements of the two matrices. In the provided Python functions, `matrix_selection_two_args` function can be used to achieve this. It applies the provided binary function (`max` in this case) to the corresponding elements of the two matrices.",
    "The given `lighten_blend_8` function in C++ can be equivalently written in python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_max_pixel(p1, p2):\n        return reduce_max([p1, p2])\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_max_pixel)\n```\n\nHere, `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to apply the operation element-wise on two matrices. Each operation is a comparison between the corresponding elements of 'base' and 'active' matrices, to select the maximum one. The function `select_max_pixel` is created inline to compare two pixels and select the maximum one using `reduce_max` function. The resulting matrix has the blend of the base and active matrices.",
    "The given 'lighten_blend_8' function in C++ takes two 2D vectors 'base' and 'active', and creates a new output 2D vector where each element is the maximum element between the corresponding elements in 'base' and 'active'. \n\nThis can be rewritten in Python using the given functions as follows:\n\n```\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nIn the python rewrite, the 'matrix_selection_two_args' function fits perfectly to implement the same logic present in the original C++ function. It iterates over two matrices (or two 2D lists in Python terminology) and applies the given two-argument function to the corresponding elements. With max as the two-argument function, this will return a new matrix where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in base and active just like the original C++ function."
