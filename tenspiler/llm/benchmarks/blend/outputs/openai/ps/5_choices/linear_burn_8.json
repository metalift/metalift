    "Below is the corresponding Python function that maintains the semantic equivalence of the given C++ function using the methods provided. The function `linear_burn_8` takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` as arguments. It represents the operation of adding corresponding pixel values from the input matrices and then subtracting 32 from each result.\n\n```python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    sum_matrix = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(32, sum_matrix)\n```\n\nIn this function, we first called `matrix_elemwise_add` to add the matrix `base` and `active` element-wise. Then we subtracted 32 from every element in the resulting matrix using the function `matrix_scalar_sub`. It corresponds directly to the provided C++ function.",
    "The Python equivalent for the above C++ function is:\n\nNote: Implementing the function `linear_burn_8` using the given Python functions with the following assumptions: \n1. The given matrices(base, active) have the same size \n2. They have at least one row and one column. \n\n```python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    # Equivalent to subtracting 32 from each element of the matrix obtained by adding the two given matrices. \n    return matrix_scalar_sub( 32, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active) )\n```\n\nThis solution uses the function `matrix_elemwise_add` to add the elements of the two input matrix `base` and `active`, then uses `matrix_scalar_sub` to subtract 32 from each element of the resulting matrix. The result is equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of your test function using the pre-defined functions:\n\n```\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    # define the logic for applying the linear burn on two values\n    def burn(a, b):\n        return a + b - 32\n    \n    # apply the burn function elementwise on the given matrices\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, burn)\n```\nThis function performs element-wise operation on the two input matrices `base` and `active` using the defined `burn` function, and ensures to meet the boundary condition (subtracting 32). The semantics of this function is exactly the same as the original C++ function \"linear_burn_8\".",
    "You can express the `linear_burn_8` function using the provided functions in Python as follows. Here, we use the `matrix_elemwise_add` function to add the `base` and `active` matrices elementwise. Then, we use the `matrix_scalar_sub` function to subtract 32 from each element of the resultant matrix.\n\n```python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(32, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```\n\nThe `matrix_elemwise_add` function adds the two input matrices on an element-by-element basis. Then, the `matrix_scalar_sub` subtracts 32 from each element of the resultant matrix. This represents the same operation performed by the original C++ function where it was done inside a loop over each row and column. But here, we are expressing the same operation in a functional style describing the whole operation on the matrices rather than walking through them element by element. Both approaches yield the same result.",
    "Here is the Python version of the C++ function `linear_burn_8`. We can use the provided functions and Python's native capabilities to accomplish this. Specifically, we will use the `matrix_elemwise_add` to add `base` and `active` matrices element-wise. Then, we\u2019ll use the `matrix_scalar_sub` function to subtract 32 from all elements in the resultant matrix.\n\n```python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    # Add base and active matrices element-wise\n    added_matrices = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n\n    # Subtract 32 from every element in the added matrix\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(32, added_matrices)\n```\n\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the Provided C++ `linear_burn_8` function. It first adds the `base` and `active` matrices together (just like the inner loop in the C++ function), then subtracts 32 from each element in the result (copying the 'subtract 32' step in the C++ function)."
