    "The given C++ function can be converted into Python code using the following functional style. We are using only the provided functions in this solution to generate the output matrix.\n\n```python\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    f = (lambda x: (2*x + x - 2*x*x//255 - 255) if x >= 128 else (2*x*x//255))\n    return vec_map(base, f)\n```\nThis rewritten Python function `overlay_blend_8` is maintained semantically equivalent to the given `test` C++ function. Here, we are using the `vec_map`, which applies the lambda function `f` on each value of the input list `base`. The lambda function `f` is the computation logic converted directly from C++, which is applied according to the value of a corresponding element in the base list.",
    "Indeed, the C++ function provided (\"overlay_blend_8\") is performing a specific pixel operation on an image represented as a 2D matrix. The pixel adjustment specific to this function is known as \"overlay blending mode\" which is often used in image processing. Here is the Python equivalent function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    \n    def blending_mode(base_pixel):\n        return (2 * base_pixel * base_pixel) // 255 if base_pixel < 128 else (2 * base_pixel - 2 * base_pixel * base_pixel // 255 - 255) # Define local blend mode function\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blending_mode) # Apply blend function to each pixel pair\n```\n\nI have replaced the iterative nested for loop from the C++ function with a simple function that takes two arguments (original pixel intensity and altered pixel intensity). The output of this function is the result from applying the blend mode. \n\nThen, I use the matrix_selection_two_args which applies this function to each corresponding pair of elements throughout the two 2D matrices (images). Please note that the 'active' image is not being used in this function despite being an input, which is consistent with the provided C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python version of the `overlay_blend_8` function. We've used the `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_scalar_mul`, `matrix_scalar_sub`, and `matrix_elemwise_mul` functions from the ones you listed. We're also relying on the provided `matrix_elemwise_div` function to account for the division by 255 in the original C++ code.\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    condition = [item >= 128 for sublist in base for item in sublist]\n    condition = [condition[i:i+len(sublist)] for i in range(0, len(condition), len(sublist))]\n\n    true_path = matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_scalar_mul(2, base), matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(matrix_scalar_mul(2, base), base), 255))\n    false_path = matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(matrix_scalar_mul(2, base), base), 255)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(true_path, false_path, lambda x, y: x if condition else y)\n```\n\nIn this case, we first determine whether or not each pixel should be updated according to the \"overlay blend\" condition. Then, we compute the pixel values for both cases (true and false) before applying the selection via `matrix_selection_two_args`. We return the chosen result.\n\nNote: the python equivalent of the given C++ code is making use of functional programming concepts which might seem a bit complex if one is new to these concepts.",
    "In Python, you can use the defined functions to rewrite the overlay_blend_8 function:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    def blend_func(b, a):\n        if b >= 128:\n            return 2 * b + b - 2 * b * b // 255 - 255\n        else:\n            return 2 * b * b // 255\n            \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend_func)\n```\n- The blend_func function encapsulates the pixel blend logic.\n- The matrix_selection_two_args function is used to apply blend_func to every pair of corresponding elements in the base and active matrices, which will replace the nested loops. The result is a matrix with the same shapes as base and active, where each element is the result of blend_func applied to the corresponding elements in base and active.",
    "The C++ function `overlay_blend_8` takes in two 2D vectors `base` and `active`, then it creates a new 2D vector `out` using a specific piece of algebra on the `base` vector. Even though it is named `active`, the `active` vector here is not used at all in the calculation.\n\nThe function returns a `out` 2D vector in which each value is calculated from the corresponding value in the `base` vector by the formula \n\n```cpp\n2 * base[row][col] + base[row][col] - 2 * base[row][col] * base[row][col] / 255 - 255\n```\nif the corresponding value in the base is greater than or equal to 128, else\n\n```cpp\n2 * base[row][col] * base[row][col] / 255\n```\n\nHere is how you can express the above function with the provided python helper functions.\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base):\n    def create_pixel(pixel):\n        if pixel >= 128:\n            return 2 * pixel + pixel - 2 * pixel * pixel // 255 - 255\n        else:\n            return 2 * pixel * pixel // 255\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, lambda p1, p2: create_pixel(p1))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply `create_pixel` function cell-by-cell on the 'base' matrix. A lambda function is used here to pass a function of two arguments that only uses one of them, keeping inline with the rules of `matrix_selection_two_args`. The dummy second argument is necessary to meet the function's requirement for a two-argument lambda function, even though we don't use it."
