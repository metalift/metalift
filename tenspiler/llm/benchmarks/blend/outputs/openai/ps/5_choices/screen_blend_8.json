    "You can rewrite the given C++ `test` Function using the provided Python functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    # Define function to calculate pixel value\n    def calculate_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return base_pixel + active_pixel - ((base_pixel * active_pixel) // 32)\n    \n    # Use `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `calculate_pixel` as the function to apply\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, calculate_pixel)\n```\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function effectively applies the `calculate_pixel` function to corresponding pairs of elements (pixels) in the `base` and `active` matrices (2D vectors in C++), akin to nested loops in the original C++ code. \n\nThis Python function `screen_blend_8` is semantically equivalent to the original C++ `test` function based on your provided functions and constants.",
    "In order to rewrite this function, we need first to create a helper function `blend_pixels` which receives two integers and returns their blended value according to given formula. Then we use the function `matrix_selection_two_args` to pass the `blend_pixels` function to each pair of pixels in the `base` and `active` matrices.\n\nPlease see the Python equivalent of the C++ function below:\n```python\ndef blend_pixels(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    return base_pixel + active_pixel - (base_pixel * active_pixel) // 32\n\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, blend_pixels)\n```\nThe function `blend_pixels` takes two pixels (one from base, one from active), applies the 'Screen' blend mode to them, and returns the resulting pixel. The function `screen_blend_8` uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply `blend_pixels` function to each pair of pixels in the `base` and `active` images. The result is an image that is a blend of the base and the active images.",
    "Sure, I can help you translate that C++ function to Python using the provided functions.\n\nSo, we need to build a new matrix where each pixel in 'out' is the value of each pixel in 'base' plus each pixel in 'active', minus the result of their multiplication divided by 32. All operations must be done elementwise, hence we must operate pixel by pixel. Simply, we need to use many elementwise operations and avoid loops. First, we sum 'base' with 'active' using matrix_elemwise_add function. Then, the result of this operation is subtracted by the result of elementwise multiplication of 'base' and 'active' divided by 32. \n\nLet's translate this to python using provided functions:\n\n```\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(\n            matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), \n            matrix_scalar_div(32, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n           )\n``` \n\nThis function is equivalent to C++ function provided with usage of given functions.",
    "After looking at the C++ function, it's clear that the function is performing a pixel-wise operation on two input image matrices -- 'base' and 'active'. For every pixel in these input images, the function calculates a new pixel value for the output image. \n\nThe calculation follows the formula: pixel = base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 32\n\nThe equivalent Python function using the provided set of functions is:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    new_base = matrix_elemwise_div(base, [[32]*len(base[0])]*len(base)) # Dividing base by 32\n    multiplied_matrix = matrix_elemwise_mul(new_base, active) # Multiplying base and active pixel-wise\n    added_matrix = matrix_elemwise_add(base, active) # Adding base and active pixel-wise\n    result = matrix_elemwise_sub(added_matrix, multiplied_matrix) # Subtracting the multiplied matrix from the added matrix\n    return result\n```\nNote that given the set of functions, if the elements of matrices are not integer, the multiplication and division might be imprecise because we are using integer division (`//`). \n\nThis Python function will return the same result as the given C++ function for the case of integer input matrices.",
    "Here is a Python function using only the provided operators functions which is semantically equivalent to the given C++ `screen_blend_8` function:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    def blend_func(b, a):\n        return b + a - (b * a) // 32\n\n    def vec_blend_func(vec_b, vec_a):\n        return selection_two_args(vec_b, vec_a, blend_func)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, vec_blend_func)\n```\nThe `blend_func` is a separate function that replicates the pixel blending operation from the original function. The `vec_blend_func` applies `blend_func` to corresponding pairs of numbers from two given numerical vectors. The `screen_blend_8` function then uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply `vec_blend_func` to corresponding pairs of rows from the two input matrices, producing the same output as the given function. The Python's `//` operator and the `32` constant are directly available in Python, so they are not listed among the provided functions/constants, but they are still used, as the original function requires."
