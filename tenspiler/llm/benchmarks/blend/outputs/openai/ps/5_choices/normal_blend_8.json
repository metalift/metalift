    "Using the given Python functions, the equivalent function to the given C++ `test` function would look like this:\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef vec_elemwise_blend(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(\n        vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active),\n        vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base)\n    )\n\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_blend(base, active, opacity)\n```\nIn the `vec_elemwise_blend` function, we calculate element-wise `(opacity * active[i] + (32 - opacity) * base[i])` operation on the given vectors `base` and `active` with `opacity` as a blending mask. This is semantically equivalent to the given `normal_blend_8` C++ function.\n\nPlease note: Python, unlike C++, operates mainly in terms of lists rather than vectors. You will need Python 3.8 or higher to run the script due to the usage of the `:=` operator.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using only the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    # scale the active vector by opacity\n    active_scaled = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n\n    # scale the base vector by (32 - opacity)\n    base_scaled = vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base)\n\n    # combine the scaled vectors\n    out = vec_elemwise_add(active_scaled, base_scaled)\n\n    return out\n```",
    "Given the function definitions, the function `normal_blend_8` can be rewritten in python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nIn the C++ version, the `normal_blend_8` function manually iterates over the elements of `base` and `active`, multiplies each element by `opacity` or `32 - opacity`, and then adds the results together. The python version uses the defined `vec_scalar_mul` operation to individually multiply all elements of `base` and `active` by a scalar, and `vec_elemwise_add` operation to add the corresponding elements together, which creates a new list of the results. This is semantically equivalent to the C++ version.",
    "Here is the rewrite of the test function using Python and the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    active_scaled = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    base_scaled   = vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base)\n    out = vec_elemwise_add(active_scaled, base_scaled)\n    return out \n```\n\nThis function works by first scaling the `active` and `base` vectors by their corresponding opacities. The function `vec_scalar_mul` performs element-wise multiplication of a vector with a scalar, which gives us the effect of multiplying each element `i` in the vectors `active` and `base` by `opacity` and `(32-opacity)`, respectively, as in the original `normal_blend_8` function. Then we add these two scaled vectors element-wise using `vec_elemwise_add`, which gives us the required output vector. The resulting list `out` will be equivalent to the output from the original `normal_blend_8` function.",
    "Here is the Python version of your C++ function `normal_blend_8` using your pre-defined functions. \n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    out_1 = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    out_2 = vec_scalar_mul(32 - opacity, base)\n    return vec_elemwise_add(out_1, out_2)\n```\n\nHere, in `normal_blend_8` function:\n\n- First, in `out_1` we are multiplying each element inside the `active` vector with `opacity` using the `vec_scalar_mul` function.\n\n- Then in `out_2`, we are multiplying each element inside the `base` vector with `32 - opacity` using the `vec_scalar_mul` function.\n\n- Finally, we are adding up corresponding elements of `out_1` and `out_2` using the `vec_elemwise_add` function."
