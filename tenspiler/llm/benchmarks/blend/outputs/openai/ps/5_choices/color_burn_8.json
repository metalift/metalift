    "Here is the Python version of your C++ function, using only the given functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    # Helper function for the pixel calculation\n    def pixel_calculation(a, b):\n        if b == 0:\n            return 32\n        else:\n            return 32 - scalar_vec_div(32 - a, [b])[0]\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_calculation)\n```\n\nThis function uses `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply a function elementwise over two 2D arrays (or matrices). The helper function `pixel_calculation` performs the calculation that defines each pixel in the output matrix. Please be aware that this function might not perform as you expect if the `base` and `active` inputs are not of the same dimensions.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent to your provided C++ function using the defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def pixel_adjustment(b, a):\n        if a == 0:\n            return 32\n        else:\n            return 32 - (32 - b) // a\n            \n    pixel_adjustment_vec = lambda x, y: [pixel_adjustment(x[i], y[i]) for i in range(len(x))]\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_adjustment_vec)\n```",
    "Here is your equivalent python function using only the provided set of functions and constants:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def burn(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return 32 if active_pixel == 0 else 32 - (32 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, burn)\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a pixel-level \"burn\" function, and then applies this function to every corresponding pair of pixels in the `base` and `active` images. It uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply the burn function across the entire matrices.\n\nThe `burn` function follows the rules described in the C++ code: if the pixel in the active image is zero, the result is 32; otherwise, it subtracts the base pixel value from 32, divides by the active pixel value, and subtracts the result from 32. The division is integer division (//), to match the behavior of the division in C++.",
    "The given C++ code applies a \"color burn\" effect on an image by processing a \"base\" and an \"active\" layer. The \"color burn\" effect gives the image darker color. For each pixel in the base layer, it applies the following formula:\n\n`pixel = 32 - (32 - base_pixel) / active_pixel`\n\nThe only exception is when the active pixel is zero, the output is forced to be 32. We can use the `selection_two_args` defined in Python with a lambda function to recreate the same logic below:\n\n```Python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: 32 if active_pixel == 0 else 32 - (32 - base_pixel) // active_pixel\n    )\n```\n\nNote that the C++ code uses `(32 - base_pixel) / active_pixel`, but I used `(32 - base_pixel) // active_pixel` in this translated Python code because Python uses `//` for integer division, which is equivalent to `/` in C++ for integers.",
    "Your `color_burn_8` function in C++ can be rewritten using the provided Python functions as below.\n\nFirstly, you want to perform elementwise operations on two matrices, which is the equivalent of looping through the rows and columns in your C++ code to calculate each pixel. Secondly, you have some conditions based on pixel value which requires the `selection_two_args` function.\n\nHere's the Python version:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def select_pixels(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        if active_pixel == 0:\n            return 32\n        else:\n            return 32 - ((32 - base_pixel) // active_pixel)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixels)\n```\n\nIn this Python function, `select_pixels` function represents the main logic applied for each pixel. It receives two arguments (a pixel from the base image and a corresponding pixel from the active image), applies the conditions similar to your C++ code logic. Then matrix_selection_two_args is used to apply this function to all elements in your base and active matrices. It implies the double loop used in your C++ code. As a result, you get a semantically equivalent Python program using the provided Python functions."
