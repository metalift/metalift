    "Here is the Python code equivalent to the `dissolve_blend_8` C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0]) if m > 0 else 0\n    out = []\n    for row in range(m):\n        row_vec = []\n        for col in range(n):\n            rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n            pixel = active[row][col] if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base[row][col]\n            row_vec.append(pixel)\n        out.append(row_vec)\n    return out\n```\n\nNote `//` is used for division to ensure the result is an `int` (integer division), matching the behavior of `/` in C++ .\n\nHowever as per your request if we should only use the above defined python methods, then we can't since those methods are for vectorized operations while here we need item level operations. If you want equivalent python code using map/reduce operations, you can't get exact one to one mapping as they are completely different kind of operations. However you can get similar effect using list comprehensions/map/reduce operations but there you need to deal with whole array at once rather than individual item level.",
    "The given C++ function can be rewritten in Python, using the provided set of functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def rand_val_cons(x, y):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return y if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else x\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, rand_val_cons)\n```\n\nHere we have taken the base and active matrices and the opacity and rand_cons integers as input parameters. We define a selection function `rand_val_cons` inside the function body, which takes pair of corresponding elements from matrices and applies a conditional operation to them.\n\nFinally, we use the provided matrix_selection_two_args function to perform this selection operation on `base` and `active` matrices and return the resulting 2D matrix. The `rand_val_cons` function passes as a selection function to matrix_selection_two_args function.",
    "Let's rewrite the dissolve_blend_8 function using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0])\n\n    def pixel_selector(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100.0\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return active_pixel\n        else:\n            return base_pixel\n\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_selector)\n\n    return out\n```\n\nAs we can see, the Python version essentially does the same thing as the original C++ function, but in a more Pythonic way. When it comes to the final computation of each pixel, the code uses a lambda function to achieve what the original C++ code was doing through an if-else statement. This function, `pixel_selector`, is passed as an argument to `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies it to all elements in the 'base' and 'active' matrices.\n\nFinally, the return statement simply outputs the result matrix.\n\nNote: Python\u2019s data structures and syntax allow us to define functions like `dissolve_blend_8` more compactly than in C++. One key difference, between the Python code and the C++, is that Python allows us to pass a function (`pixel_selector`) as an argument to another function (`matrix_selection_two_args`). This functionality makes it easier to define composite functions like `dissolve_blend_8`.",
    "Below is the Python equivalent of the given `dissolve_blend_8` C++ function using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    n = len(base)\n    m = len(base[0]) if n != 0 else 0\n    def rand_val_map(pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n        return rand_val\n    def pixel_select_two_args_arg(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = rand_val_map(base_pixel)\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            pixel = active_pixel\n        else:\n            pixel = base_pixel\n        return pixel\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_select_two_args_arg)\n```\n\nThe `dissolve_blend_8` function takes in two 2D matrix 'base' and 'active', and two integers 'opacity' and 'rand_cons'. It iteratively checks each pixel from the 'base' and 'active' matrix. If the 'opacity' minus the 'rand_val' is greater than or equal to zero, it picks the pixel from the 'active' matrix, otherwise it picks the pixel from the 'base' matrix. The result is returned as a 2D matrix.\n\nFirst, it calculates the number of rows and cols in the 'base' matrix. Then it defines 'rand_val_map' function which gets a 'pixel' as input and returns 'rand_val'. The 'rand_val' is calculated by taking mod of 'rand_cons' with 100, adding 1 to it and then floor dividing by 100.\n\nNext, it defines 'pixel_select_two_args_arg' which uses 'rand_val_map' to get 'rand_val' for each base_pixel. It then checks if 'opacity' - 'rand_val' is greater than or equal to zero, if true it selects the pixel from 'active' matrix otherwise it selects the pixel from 'base' matrix.\n\nFinally, it applies 'pixel_select_two_args_arg' to matrix 'base' and 'active' using 'matrix_selection_two_args' to get the result matrix.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the defined functions and constants provided will be:\n\n```Python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n  # Define a helper function \"select_pixel\" that we can pass to \"matrix_selection_two_args\"\n  # This helper function will make decisions on whether to select the pixel from \"base\" or \"active\" matrix\n  def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100  # Note that I'm using integer division here because both rand_cons and 100 are integers\n    return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n\n  # Now call matrix_selection_two_args with the helper function and the two matrices\n  return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `matrix_selection_two_args` function to apply an operation to each corresponding pair of elements from two 2D matrices. The operation is defined in the `select_pixel` helper function, and it implements the same logic as in your C++ function. Remember that because Python is a dynamically-typed language, we can pass functions as arguments to other functions, which is what we're doing by passing `select_pixel` to `matrix_selection_two_args`.\n\nMoreover, note that the division operator `/` in Python returns a float result, even when both operands are integers, which isn't the case in C++, where `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers. As such, we use `//` in the Python code for the operation `(rand_cons % 100) + 1 / 100` to mimic the C++ integer division behavior.",
    "You can rewrite the dissolve_blend_8 function in python using the provided functions. The desired functionality is to iterate over two 2D arrays, perform some operation and return a new 2D array. We can achieve this using the matrix_selection_two_args function where the select_two_args_arg function will embody the operation to be performed on each pixel.\n\nHere is the equivalent python function:\n\n```Python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    def select_pixel(b, a):\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return a\n        else:\n            return b\n            \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nThis python function's behavior matches the C++ function. It will iterate over the base and active arrays in a pixel by pixel manner, applying the select_pixel function to decide between each corresponding pair of base and active, and then return a new 2D array. The select_pixel function mimics the behavior of the additional calculations and the if-else condition in the C++ function.",
    "Given that you need to rewrite the provided C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function using only the provided Python functions to achieve semantic equivalence, below is your solution:\n\nPython equivalent function:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_pix(base_pix, active_pix):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n        return active_pix if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pix\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pix)\n```\n\nHere, the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to loop over each pixel of the base and active images. `select_pix` function is also defined to select a pixel from either the active or base images based on the calculated `rand_val` and the given `opacity`.\n\nPlease note that, due to the explicit integer division in Python (// operator), the calculated `rand_val` will always be 0 unless `rand_cons` is 100 or above. This is different from C++ where / operator performs classic division. If you need float division (like in C++), you should replace // with / and round it towards zero to keep the same behavior your C++ function. However, as the set of defined functions does not provide any rounding functionality, I have used the // operator for now. If you need the float division please let me know.",
    "To rewrite the C++ code in Python using the provided set of functions and constants, first we need to understand the logic behind the C++ function `dissolve_blend_8`.\n\nThis function is blending two images (represented as matrices), base and active, using a dissolve blend mode technique. It assigns each pixel of the final blended image according to whether the chosen value is greater than or less than the opacity level. \n\nHere is how one would translate it:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def choose_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, choose_pixel)\n```\n\nIn above Python code `matrix_selection_two_args` is equivalent to looping over two matrices base and active in `dissolve_blend_8` C++ function. \n\nThe `choose_pixel` is equivalent to `if else` condition inside the C++ function. We calculate `rand_val` and then choose whether to pick pixel from active or base image depending upon the condition whether opacity - rand_val is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nKindly, ensure you have already defined `matrix_selection_two_args` function in your code environment before using it.",
    "The given C++ function can be rewritten in Python using the provided set of functions. \n\nHowever, there are some clarifications required for the requested task.\n\n1. The C++ function `dissolve_blend_8` includes randomness via the `rand_cons` variable. This does not have a direct replacement in the provided Python functions. If you require pure reproduction of this randomness, we need to include Python's randomness library. If not, please clarify how to handle this variable.\n   \n2. The provided Python functions are based on recursion, which is a heavy operation and can exceed Python's recursion limit when dealing with large vectors or matrices. If the input size could be large, it would be better to use iteration-based approach.\n\n3. The Python function and its dependant functions are using integer division (`//`) which will round down the results of divisions whereas the C++ function is using floating point division (`/`) which will preserve the decimal. This could produce different results between the Python and C++ versions.\n\nGiven the limitations and considerations stated above, here's how your function could be translated given the current circumstances.\n\n```Python\ndef generate_rand_values(matrix, rand_cons): # this is required to generate the random matrix similar to the C++ function\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0]) if m > 0 else 0\n    return [[((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n\ndef less_than_or_equal_to(x, y):\n    return x <= y\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(matrix_base, matrix_active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    matrix_rand = generate_rand_values(matrix_base, rand_cons)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        matrix_base,\n        matrix_active,\n        lambda x, y: y if less_than_or_equal_to(opacity - x, 0) else x\n    )\n```\n\nThis `dissolve_blend_8` function should be equivalent to your C++ function `dissolve_blend_8`.",
    "The equivalent Python version of the provided `dissolve_blend_8` function in C++ is: \n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n\n    def get_pixel(x, y):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return y if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, get_pixel)\n```\n\nIn the provided Python function `dissolve_blend_8`, we make use of the definition function `matrix_selection_two_args`. The `get_pixel` function in Python is analogous construct to the if-else statement present inide the two for-loops in the provided C++ function. It gets two arguments `x` and `y` analogous to `base[row][col]` and `active[row][col]` in C++ code. The selection function either returns y (`active[row][col]`) if `opacity - rand_val >= 0` else returns x (`base[row][col]`), similar to the behavior of the C++ function.  The function `matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, get_pixel)` applies the `get_pixel` function to each pair of elements in `base` and `active` which corresponds to changing the content of each pixel as per their opacity and random value in the original C++ function."
