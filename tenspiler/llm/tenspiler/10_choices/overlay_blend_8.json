    "Given the above-defined functions and the `overlay_blend_8` C++ function to be rewritten in Python, the corresponding Python code would look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n  return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(base_col, _):  \n  if base_col >= 128:\n    return (((2 * base_col) + base_col) - (((2 * base_col) * base_col) / 255)) - 255\n  else:\n    return ((2 * base_col) * base_col) / 255\n```\n\nIn the above Python code, the `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to iterate over each pixel in the base matrix, and for each pixel, the `select_two_args` is called. Within this function, if the pixel value is greater than or equal to 128, it calculates the new pixel value as per the given operation (equivalent to the true section of the if condition in your C++ code), else it calculates the new pixel value using a different operation (equivalent to the else section of your C++ code). The second parameter in `select_two_args` is a dummy parameter as there is no usage of it within the function. It's necessary because the `matrix_selection_two_args` function requires a function that takes two arguments.\n\nPlease note that this Python code is based on the assumption that the list of functions provided in the prompt are already defined in the current scope where this code is being executed.",
    "According to the information provided, the `overlay_blend_8` function can be rewritten as follows in Python using the Python functions you provided:\n\n```Python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_x) * int_x) / 255)\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\nNote that `overlay_blend_8` function takes two arguments: `base` and `active`, but `active` is not used in its calculation. It creates a new matrix where each cell is calculated using `select_two_args` function on its corresponding cell in the `base` matrix. Remember that these functions operate on matrices of integers and are specifically designed for this purpose.",
    "Based on the given C++ code, the `overlay_blend_8` python function that uses the predefined functions and its semantic equivalent first helper function `select_two_args` function could be defined as:\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    if int_x >= 128:\n        return (((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255\n    else:\n        return ((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\nMore about these functions:\n\n1. `select_two_args`: This function takes two arguments, simulates the pixel logic calculation that we have in the C++ code. If the first argument `int_x` is greater or equal to `128`, it will return the first equation, else it will return the second equation.\n\n2. `overlay_blend_8`: This function takes `base` matrix as both input arguments for the `matrix_selection_two_args` function as in the given C++ code, the operation is done over the `base` matrix only and `active` matrix is not in use. For the element-wise operation, it uses our defined `select_two_args` function. We use the `matrix_selection_two_args` instead of nested loops as in the given C++ code which provides a more pythonic way of implementing the same logic.",
    "Here is the Python rewrite of the given C++ function `overlay_blend_8` using the provided set of functions and constants:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) // 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) // 255)\n```\n\nThe select_two_args function is argument to the matrix_selection_two_args so that it can apply to each matching pair of elements in the base matrices. It checks if the base element `int_x` is greater or equal to 128 then applies the calculation which corresponds to the `overlay_blend_8`'s logic if base elements are greater or equal to 128, else it applies the calculation which corresponds to the else part of the `overlay_blend_8`'s logic. This select_two_args function is the equivalent Python rewrite of the if-else condition inside the for-loop of the `overlay_blend_8` function.\n \nThe operator \"//\" instead of \"/\" is to handle integer division as the underlying code seems to be doing integer division. This is assumed based on the fact that pixel intensities in images are usually represented by integers. The image's pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255 in integer. Therefore, the pixel operation in image processing usually involves integer arithmetic, so the \"//\" is used instead of \"/\".",
    "You can use `matrix_selection_two_args` to replace the outer loop. This function applies the selection function to each corresponding pair of elements from the two input matrices. We need to represent the condition in the selection function using Python.\n\nHere is the rewritten function in Python:\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8_ps(base, active, overlay_blend_8_rv, select_two_args):\n    overlay_blend_8_rv = matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n    return overlay_blend_8_rv\n\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255)\n```\n\nIn this case, as pixel formulas are applied element-wise to the matrices, both `base` and `active` matrices are the same (`base`). The `select_two_args` function in Python includes the same checks and calculations as in the given `overlay_blend_8` C++ function.",
    "To rewrite the C++ function into Python using provided methods, you can define these two functions:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) // 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) // 255)\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nHere, `select_two_args` function provides the pixel value comparison and calculation logic from the C++ function. It is applied between corresponding elements of two identical copies of the base matrix using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which matches the looped execution over the rows and columns in the C++ function. The result of the whole C++ function execution is then obtained by calling `overlay_blend_8`.",
    "Given the available primitives defined above, here is how you can define the `overlay_blend_8` function in Python to be equivalent with the given `C++` function. The computation is performed in element-wise manner for the 2D matrix. It's basically applying the `select_two_args` operation to each corresponding pair of elements in the two matrices.\n\nFirst, we need to define the `select_two_args()` function.\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) // 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) // 255)\n```\n\nNext, use the `matrix_selection_two_args()` for the `overlay_blend_8` function.\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nNote that we use integer division `//` instead of `float` division `/` to keep the return values as integers, similar what's happening in original C++ version of the code.",
    "Here's how we could rewrite the C++ function `overlay_blend_8(base, active)` using Python and helper functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union\n\ndef two_args_fn(a:int, b:int) -> int:\n    return (2*a + a - 2*a*a//255 - 255) if a >= 128 else (2*a*a//255)\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base: list[list[int]], active: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, two_args_fn)\n```\n\nIn the function `two_args_fn`, we implement the pixel value calculation in exactly the same way as in your C++ function. Please note that both the input argument lists 'base' and 'active' are passed to `matrix_selection_two_args` function but 'active' is not actually used in pixel value calculation as per your original C++ function. Following your Python equivalent function prompt and C++ function, it just acts as a placeholder.",
    "The given C++ \"overlay_blend_8\" function could be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8_rv(int_x, int_y):\n    return (\n        ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255)\n        if int_x >= 128\n        else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255)\n    )\n\ndef overlay_blend_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, overlay_blend_8_rv)\n```\nThe \"overlay_blend_8\" function provided takes two input matrices, 'base' and 'active'. However, from the provided C++ function, it's clear that 'active' is not used in any computation. For this reason, the second parameter 'active' can be ignored in the mitigation.\n\nThe function \"overlay_blend_8_ps\" performs the same operation as the C++ \"overlay_blend_8\" function. It makes the conditional computation for each pixel value in the 'base' matrix based on the python lambda function \"overlay_blend_8_rv\", and finally combines all processed pixel values to form the output matrix.",
    "To transform the C++ program into Python using the predefined functions, the equivalent Python function will be as below. Here we use `matrix_selection_two_args` to perform operations on each row of the `base` matrix and we define `select_two_args` function used by `matrix_selection_two_args`. Each pixel in the row will perform the operations by the `select_two_args` function.\n\nBeware that the condition `if int_x >= 128 else` is defined inside the `select_two_args` function, which carries the operations from C++ to Python.\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255)\n```\n\nThis Python code will produce the same result as the provided C++ function. This `overlay_blend_8` function receives two parameters, `base` and `active`. It applies the `select_two_args` operations to each pixel in the `base` matrix and returns a new matrix."
