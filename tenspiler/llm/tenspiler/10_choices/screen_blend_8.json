    "Sure, here is your `screen_blend_8` function in Python using provided functions:\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\nThis function will achieve the same screen blend operation as the C++ function by using the provided matrix and vector operations. Note `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_elemwise_sub`, `matrix_elemwise_mul`, and `matrix_scalar_div` are function which perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and element-wise division with a scalar on the matrices respectively.",
    "You can rewrite the `screen_blend_8` function as follows in Python:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), 255))\n```\nIn the newly rewritten function, the `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` operation performs element-wise addition between the 'base' and 'active' matrices, which corresponds to `base[row][col] + active[row][col]` in the original C++ function.\n\nNext, `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` operation corresponds to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col])` in the C++ function. This is divided by 255 using `matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), 255)`, which corresponds to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` in the C++ function.\n\nFinally, the subtraction operation is performed by `matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_elemwise_div(matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active), 255))`, where the quantities calculated earlier are subtracted, matching with the `base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` operation in the C++ function.\n\nAll these operations are performed on the entire matrices, yielding the same functionality as the original two nested loops in the C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python version of the function `screen_blend_8` using the provided functions: \n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```",
    "You can rewrite the `screen_blend_8` function in C++ as `screen_blend_8_ps` in Python with the predefined functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\nThe function `screen_blend_8_ps` performs the same operation as `screen_blend_8`. It performs a pixel-wise screen blending of two images represented by `base` and `active`. The output image is a combination of the base and active images, where the colors are inverted, overlapped, and then inverted again.",
    "The equivalent function in Python using the provided set of functions would be:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\nThe values from base and active are added together using `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)`. Thereafter, the product of base and active values are divided by the scalar 255 using `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))`. Finally, the results are subtracted from one another using `matrix_elemwise_sub(...)`.",

    "Here is how you can rewrite the `screen_blend_8` C++ function using the provided Python functions:\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(\n               matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), \n               matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n           )\n```\nHere, `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` represents the addition of the `base` and `active` matrices, `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` represents the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active`, and `matrix_scalar_div(255, ...)` represents dividing each result of the multiplication by 255. Finally, `matrix_elemwise_sub(...)` subtracts the result of the division operation from the result of addition, element-wise, across the entire matrix, as per the original function.",
    "Your provided C++ function `screen_blend_8` can be rewritten using your Python functions as follows:\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\nThis Python function applies the blending algorithm to each pixel of the `base` and `active` images, similar to the C++ function. First, it applies an element-wise addition to the `base` and `active` images. Then, it subtracts the result of an element-wise multiplication of the `base` and `active` images scaled down by 255. The subtraction is also applied element-wise. The result is a new image that has been blended according to the Screen blending mode.",
    "To rewrite the given `test` C++ function `screen_blend_8`, you can use the provided Python functions `matrix_elemwise_add`, `matrix_elemwise_mul`, and `matrix_scalar_div`.

It takes `base` and `active` as input, which are two matrices (represented as lists of lists in Python). For each \"pixel\" in both matrices, it calculates a new pixel value according to the formula `base[row][col] + active[row][col] - (base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255`, adds the new pixel value to a new row and adds the new row to the output matrix `out`.\n\nIn the rewritten code, the operation is vectorized using the provided functions:\n\n- `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` adds `base` and `active` element-wise.\n- `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` multiplies `base` and `active` element-wise.\n- `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))` divides each element of the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` by 255.\n- `matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))` subtracts the latter result from the element-wise addition of base and active, resulting in the final output.",
