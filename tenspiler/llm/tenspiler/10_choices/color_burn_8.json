    "Here is how you can rewrite the given C++ function using provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis Python function `color_burn_8` does the same as the C++ function. It iterates over each pixel in the `base` and `active` matrices. For each pixel, it checks if the value in the `active` matrix is zero. If it is, it assigns the value 255 to the corresponding position in the output matrix, otherwise, it calculates new pixel value using formula `255 - ((255 - base_pixel) / active_pixel)` where `base_pixel` and `active_pixel` are corresponding values in the `base` and `active` matrices. The division operation here is integer division, just like in the C++ code.\n\nThe `select_two_args` function calculates new pixel value for a pair of pixels from the `base` and `active` matrices. It represents the task performed inside the innermost loop in the C++ function.\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the `select_two_args` operation to every pair of corresponding pixels in the `base` and `active` matrices. This operation is applied in a matrix-wise manner, corresponding to the task performed in the two nested loops in the C++ code.",
    "You can achieve the semantically equivalent functionality using the provided functions and constants in Python script as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8_py(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n        \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\nIn the Python function `color_burn_8_py`, it internally defines `select_two_args` function which calculates the pixel value. Later, it invokes `matrix_selection_two_args` function using `active`, `base`, and `select_two_args` to process each pixel in the 2D matrices `active` and `base`.  \nPlease note this script uses // operator for integer division, just to make sure it behaves exactly the same as / operator in C++.",
    "You can rewrite the test function using Python and utilizing the provided functions and constants as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n\n    # Define helper function to calculate each pixel\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\n    # Return the resulting matrix by applying select_two_args function to each pair of corresponding pixels\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\nThis rewritten Python function achieves exactly the same functionality as the provided C++ function using the provided set of functions. Note that integer division (`//`) is used instead of floating point division (`/`) to ensure pixel values are integers as in the original C++ function.",
    "Your equivalent Python code based on the defined functions is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - (255 - int_y) // int_x\n```\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. We utilize the `matrix_selection_two_args` function replacing the nested loop structure in your original C++ code. This function effectively takes two matrices of the same dimension and applies a function (in this case, select_two_args) to each corresponding pair of elements. \n\n2. The behavior of `select_two_args` function is analogous to the operation inside the inner for loop of your C++ function. The division used here is integer division(`//`), because in python 3.x `/` performs float division. The checks are written in a similar way in Python.\n\nNote: The provided Python functions use iterative logic in a recursive style and it can lead to the RecursionError if the data size is too large. The logic can be re-implemented iteratively using for loops to avoid this potential issue.",
    "The given C++ function applies a color burn effect on an image represented as a 2D matrix. The pixels in the \"active\" layer are burned into the \"base\" layer according to the color burning formula. The color burning formula is 255 - (255 - basePixel) / activePixel. If the active pixel is 0, then the `select_two_args` function should return 255 to prevent a division by zero error. Here is semantically equivalent Python representation of the C++ function:\n\n```python\n#Defined functions\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    if int_x == 0:\n        return 255 \n    else:\n        return 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThe `color_burn_8` method is now semantically equivalent to the one in C++. It maps over the active and base pixel matrices and applies the `select_two_args` bivariate operator (which is equivalent to the pixel transformation logic in the original C++ method) elementwise to the matrices. `matrix_selection_two_args` takes care of the iteration over the rows and columns, similar to the nested for loops in the C++ method. The condition and computation in `select_two_args` are equivalent to the condition & assignment and computation & assignment in the inner for loop of the C++ method.",
    "Here is how you can rewrite the `color_burn_8` function in Python using the provided functions:\n\n```Python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - scalar_vec_div(255 - int_y, int_x)\n```\nHere, `color_burn_8` function calls `matrix_selection_two_args` that perform the operations for each pair of elements from two matrices (active and base) using `select_two_args` function. \n\nThe `select_two_args` function then checks for each pair of pixels from the base and active images. If the pixel color in active image is 0, it returns 255 (pixel is white). If not, it subtracts the result of dividing the difference of max color (255) and the base pixel color by the active pixel color from max color (255) to get the burned color pixel.\n\nRemember that `/` in Python represents floating point division and `//` represents integer floor division. Here, I've used `scalar_vec_div` which performs integer floor division, like in original C++ code. But be aware that this may result in losing some color definition, you might want to adjust this according to your needs.",
    "Your test function `color_burn_8` applies a color burning algorithm on each pixel in a two-dimensional space. Here is a Python version of the same test function which only uses the provided set of predefined functions. \n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else (255 - ((255 - int_y) / int_x))\n\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\nIn this code, `matrix_selection_two_args` function iterates over every pixel in the active and base color matrices applying `select_two_args` to each corresponding pair of pixels. \n\n`select_two_args` applies the color burn calculation to an individual pixel. If the active pixel value is 0, it will return 255 (to avoid division by zero), else, it calculates the color burn value according to the equation in your original C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python translation of the C++ `color_burn_8` function using the pre-defined functions. I assume that the elements of the input matrices are integers.\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\ndef color_burn_8(matrix_x, matrix_y):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_x, matrix_y, select_two_args)\n```\n\n`color_burn_8` applies a pixel-wise color burn operation on two images represented as 2D matrices. `select_two_args` function takes two integers, representing active and the base pixel values, as arguments and performs a color burn operation on them.\n\nPlease note that pixel values are assumed to be in the range of 0-255. If your pixel values are in different range, you may need to adjust the constant `255` accordingly.",

Otherwise, it subtracts the result of integer division of (255 minus the second argument) by the first argument from 255.\n2. `color_burn_8` function applies the `select_two_args` function element-wise to the `active` and `base` matrices and returns the resultant matrix. If the dimensions of `active` and `base` matrices are not equal, it returns an empty matrix.\n   \nPlease note that integer division is used (`//`) instead of float division (`/`) to ensure the result remains an integer, as the original C++ function used integer division (`/`). Integer division automatically discards fractional parts in Python."
