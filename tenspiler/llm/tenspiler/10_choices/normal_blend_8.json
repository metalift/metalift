    "The conversion of your C++ function to Python using the provided functions can be written like this:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base))\n```",
    "Here is your translated Python function using provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base))\n```",
    "Here is your rewritten function in Python using the provided set of functions:\n\n``` python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    opacity_active = vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)\n    opacity_max_base = vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base)\n    return vec_elemwise_add(opacity_active, opacity_max_base)\n```\nThe `normal_blend_8` function multiplies each element of the active vector with the opacity using `vec_scalar_mul`. It also calculates the multiplication of each element of the base vector with the difference of maximum opacity (255) and provided opacity. Finally, it adds the two vectors elementwise with `vec_elemwise_add` and returns the resultant vector.",
    "The `normal_blend_8` function in python can be rewritten using your provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nThis function first multiplies each element in `active` array by `opacity` and each element in `base` array by `(255 - opacity)`.

It creates a new list by adding the product of opacity and each value in 'active' with the product of (255-opacity) and each value in 'base'.",
    "Here is how the test function `normal_blend_8` can be rewritten in the Python language using the provided functions:\n\n```py\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(255 - opacity, base))\n```\nIn this rewritten code, we first multiply each element of `active` vector by `opacity` using `vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)`. Then, we subtract `opacity` from 255 and multiply each element of `base` vector by the difference using `vec_scalar_mul(255 - opacity, base)`. Finally, we add the two resultant vectors element-wise using `vec_elemwise_add()` function. This rewritten Python code is semantically equivalent to the original C++ `normal_blend_8` function.",
    "The equivalent Python function using the provided defined functions would look as follows:\n\n```Python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nThis Python function utilizes the scalar multiplication and vector addition functions to achieve the same functionality as the original C++ function. It multiplies each element of the \"active\" vector by the scalar \"opacity\", and the \"base\" vector by the scalar \"(255 - opacity)\". It then adds the results of these two computations element-wise, producing the same result as the original function.",

It uses `vec_elemwise_add` with the results of `vec_scalar_mul` on `opacity` and `active`, and `vec_scalar_mul` on `255 - opacity` and `base`, which matches the logic in the original C++ implementation.",
    "The function `normal_blend_8` in Python will look as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_8(base, active, opacity):\n    return  vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((255 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nThis function correctly reuses your predefined functions to achieve the same functionality as the C++ `normal_blend_8` function. By using `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions, it simulates the loop in the original function that iterates through the `base` vector, multiplying each element by the `opacity` and (255 - `opacity`) and adding the results together.",
    "You can rewrite the `normal_blend_8` function in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\nNote that in the provided code, `vec_scalar_mul(a, x)` multiplies each element of a vector `x` by a scalar `a` and `vec_elemwise_add(x, y)` adds two same-sized vectors `x` and `y` element-wise. These functionality matches the operations inside the loop in the original C++ function.
