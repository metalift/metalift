    "The equivalent python code to the C++ function `lighten_blend_8` by using the provided function and constants is:\n\n```python\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n\n```\nThis function takes two matrices as input, `base` and `active`. For each pair of corresponding elements in the two matrices, it selects the larger one. The resulting matrix is the same size as the input matrices. The `select_two_args` helper function is used to select the larger of two integers. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies this helper function to each pair of corresponding elements in the input matrices.",
    "Based on the provided C++ function `lighten_blend_8` which combines two 2D integer vectors `base` and `active` by comparing the corresponding values of these vectors and choosing the highest, you can write Python equivalent of the function using `matrix_selection_two_args` and `selection_two_args`. Here is the Python equivalent:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\nHere, `select_two_args` function compares two integer inputs and returns the maximum. The `lighten_blend_8` function selects corresponding elements from two 2D integer matrices `base` and `active` by using the `select_two_args` function as a selection rule, giving the same behavior as the given C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\nIn the code given above, I use the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` which takes a function as the third parameter, and uses it to select an item from each corresponding pair in two matrices. The function `select_two_args` is specifically defined to do a comparison between two values and return the higher one. This mirrors the if-else condition that was there in the original C++ code. So, each pixel (corresponding values in `base` and `active`) is selected based on this condition and the result is a matrix that mirrors the behavior of given 'lighten_blend_8' function.",
    "Your test function in Python will look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis Python function accomplishes the same task as presented C++ function. It uses the function `matrix_selection_two_args`, with selection logic implemented in `select_two_args`. This selection picks the maximum between the base and active pixel values for every pixel in the given 2D matrix, which is what your original C++ code was doing.",
    "Here is how you could re-implement the lighten_blend_8 function in Python using your pre-defined functions:\n\n```python\n\ndef lighten_blend_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n```\n\nThis Python function is equivalent to the given C++ code. Here active and base are the two input images given as 2D matrices. The select_two_args function is the per-element operation that needs to be performed to get the new image matrix. We perform a per-element comparison of the base and active pixel values and select the maximum value. The matrix_selection_two_args function applies this operation to each pair of elements in the two input matrices. The result is a new image matrix where each pixel is the maximum (lighter) value of the corresponding pixels in the base and active images. This is equivalent to Lighten blending mode in digital image processing.",
    "It seems you wish to translate the given C++ function `lighten_blend_8` into Python. We can achieve this using the `matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)` function. We define `select_two_args` such that it returns the greater of two provided numbers, which mirrors the logic in the inner if-else statement in the C++ function. Here's the corresponding python code:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(x, y):\n        return y if x < y else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThe `lighten_blend_8` function now should behave the same as the C++ function. The `base` and `active` arguments are 2D arrays, presumably representing images, and the function returns a new 2D array where each element is the maximum value of the corresponding elements in the `base` and `active` arrays. This is a common operation in image processing known as a \"lighten\" blend.",
    "Based on the provided functions in Python, you can rewrite the lighten_blend_8 function in C++ as the following function. This Python function uses recursion to evaluate each pixel, applying the max function to each pair of corresponding pixels from the base and active images. The for loops in the original C++ function are emulated via recursive function calls.\n\nIn Python:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThe first function, select_two_args, is equivalent to the condition inside the nested loops in original function. This function compares two arguments and returns the larger one. The second function, lighten_blend_8, is equivalent to the outer function with nested loops. Call matrix_selection_two_args function which takes base, active and the select_two_args function as arguments. \n\nThe matrix_selection_two_args function applies the select_two_args function to each element of the base and active matrices. The outer and inner loops from the original lighten_blend_8 function is replaced by the recursive calls within the matrix_selection_two_args function, effectively iterating over the rows and the columns of the base and active matrices respectively.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the C++ function using only the predefined functions. We use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function for comparing corresponding elements in `base` and `active` matrices, also we use `max` function as it's semantically equivalent to the comparison operation in the original `lighten_blend_8` function.\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args) \n```",
    "The provided C++ function \"lighten_blend_8\" finds the maximum value between each corresponding element in two 2D arrays (\"base\" and \"active\") and returns a new 2D array with those maximum values. \n\nThe Python equivalent of the C++ function using the provided functions will look like the following:\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n    lighten_blend_8_rv = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n    return lighten_blend_8_rv\n```\n\nIn this Python function, the inner function `select_two_args` returns the maximum of two integers. This function is then passed as an argument to the function `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies this function to every corresponding pair of elements in the two 2D arrays `base` and `active`. This behaves exactly like the C++ function `lighten_blend_8`.",
    "The given C++ function `lighten_blend_8` can be rewritten to Python by using the given set of functions and constructs as follows. This Python version should perform the equivalent operations:\n\n```python\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\nIn the `lighten_blend_8` function, we use the function `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies a function (in this case `select_two_args`) to corresponding elements of two matrices.\n\nThe `select_two_args` function is equivalent to the if-else condition inside the nested loops in the original C++ code. It compares two integers and returns the larger one, which corresponds to the \"lighter\" pixel in the blend operation."
