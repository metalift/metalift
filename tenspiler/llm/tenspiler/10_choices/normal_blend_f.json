    "The C++ `normal_blend_f` function can be re-written using the provided defined functions like this:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nHere, `vec_scalar_mul` is used to multiply the `opacity` with the `active` vector and `(1 - opacity)` with the `base` vector. The result vectors are then element-wise added together with `vec_elemwise_add`. This gives the same result as the original C++ function. This function uses list comprehension and does not involve manual iteration or appending to the list like the original C++ function.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent function of the given C++ code by using predefined functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\n\nThe original C++ function `normal_blend_f` blends two vector values `base` and `active` using the mix specified by the `opacity`, where `opacity` times `active` added to `(1 - opacity)` times `base` to get the final output. This is represented by `vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))` in Python, whereby `vec_elemwise_add` adds two vectors element-wise, `vec_scalar_mul` multiplies a vector's elements by a scalar, and `opacity`, `active`, `1 - opacity`, and `base` are inputs as specified.",
    "Here's your test function rewritten to use the set of provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\nThis python function is semantically equivalent to your C++ function `normal_blend_f`. It multiplies the `base` and `active` vectors by the `opacity` and `(1 - opacity)` respectively, using the `vec_scalar_mul` function. Then it adds the resulting vectors together using `vec_elemwise_add`. The overall effect is the same as your C++ function, but the specific details of how it works will depend on how you've defined the provided functions.",
    "Sure. Here is the equivalent function in Python using the provided operations:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(\n        vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active),\n        vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base)\n    )\n```",

It takes three parameters: `base` and `active` which are lists of integers, and `opacity` which is an integer. It uses the provided `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions to perform the same operations done in the C++ code.\n\nIn the Python function, `vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)` performs the multiplication of each element in the `active` list by `opacity` and returns a new list. `vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base)` does the same with the `base` list and the value `1 - opacity`. `vec_elemwise_add` then adds the corresponding elements of these two new lists together and returns the resulting list, which corresponds to the `out` list in the C++ function.",
    "Based on the C++ test function and available Python functions, you are looking for a Python equivalent of the `normal_blend_f` function.

    "The `normal_blend_f` function can be rewritten in Python using the defined functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(\n        vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), \n        vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base)\n    )\n```\nThis Python function `normal_blend_f` uses the definitions provided - `vec_elemwise_add` to add the corresponding elements of two input vectors element-by-element, `vec_scalar_mul` to multiply each element of the input vector with the provided scalar - and is equivalent to the given C++ `normal_blend_f` function. It returns the combined vector result.",
    "The given `test` function in C++ calculates a normal blend of two given vectors `base` and `active`, within a range determined by the `opacity` factor, and returns the result as a new vector. This is done by iterating through every element in the `base` vector and multiplying it by (1 - `opacity`), then adding the result to the corresponding `element` from the `active` vector multiplied by `opacity`.\n\nWe can obtain the same functionality by using `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` from the set of provided python functions. We multiply the `active` vector by `opacity`, the `base` vector by (1 - `opacity`), and then add the resulting vectors together. The Python equivalent of your `normal_blend_f` function is shown below:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nWe've used `vec_elemwise_add` to add the elementwise values. This function takes two vectors and returns a new vector where the i-th element is the sum of the i-th elements of the input vectors. We've used `vec_scalar_mul` to multiply each element of the vector by a scalar value. This function takes a scalar and a vector and returns a new vector where each element is the product of the scalar and the corresponding element in the input vector."
