    "Sure, here's how you can translate the provided C++ code into Python using the provided higher-order functions. \n\nIn C++, the given function finds the minimum of each pair of corresponding elements in two matrices. We can achieve the exact same functionality using matrix_selection_two_args and select_two_args provided functions. \n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nThe `darken_blend_8` function applies the `matrix_selection_two_args` function on the two input matrices `base` and `active`, where `matrix_selection_two_args` is a function that takes in two matrices and a function name, and applies the given function on each of the corresponding elements in the two matrices.\n\nThe `select_two_args` function merely returns the minimum of two provided integers which is exactly what the C++ function was doing.",
    "You can translate the `darken_blend_8` function into Python with the defined functions as follows:\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n```\nIn this translation, every pixel value in the `base` and `active` matrices is compared and the smaller value is chosen to be put in the output matrix.\nThe function `select_two_args` compares two values and returns the smaller one.\nThe function `darken_blend_8` applies the `select_two_args` function to the corresponding elements of the `base` and `active` matrices. It uses the function `matrix_selection_two_args`, which takes two matrices and a function that will be applied to every pair of corresponding elements from the two matrices.",
    "Here is a Python version of the `darken_blend_8` C++ function that uses the provided set of functions.\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n\n    darken_blend_8_rv = matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n    return darken_blend_8_rv\n```\n\nThe `select_two_args` function is defined within the `darken_blend_8` function. This function takes as input two integers and returns the smallest of the two.\n\nThe `darken_blend_8` function uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function to produce a new matrix. The values of this matrix come from either `base` or `active`, depending on which one is smaller.\n\nThe `darken_blend_8` function returns the resulting matrix.",
    "Convert the C++ function `darken_blend_8` into Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(x, y):\n        return y if x > y else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the provided C++ function `darken_blend_8`, it takes two 2D vectors `base` and `active` and returns the pixel-wise minimum of the two. This is equivalent to the `matrix_selection_two_args` function in Python, where the selection function is defined as `select_two_args` which takes two numbers and returns the smaller one.",
    "In Python, the `darken_blend_8` function can be written using given functions as:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n\n    darken_blend_8_rv = matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\n    return darken_blend_8_rv\n```\n\nThis function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. It iterates over two 2D inputs `base` and `active` in elementwise manner and returns a new 2D list where each element is the minimum of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. This is accomplished through the `matrix_selection_two_args` function along with a helper function `select_two_args` which returns the minimum of two input arguments.",
    "You can translate the C++ function `darken_blend_8` to Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\n# python equivalent of test function\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\nIn the C++ function, for each pixel in the base and active matrices, the darker of the two pixels is chosen. The `min` function does this comparison and returns the smaller of the two values. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies this operation across the entire matrix.",
    "Based on your provided functions, the equivalent python function for `darken_blend_8` can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis `darken_blend_8` function takes two matrices `base` and `active` as inputs. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is then called, passing the `active` and `base` matrices along with the helper function `select_two_args`. The `select_two_args` function takes two integers `int_x` and `int_y` as inputs and returns the smaller integer. Therefore, each pixel of the resulting image will be the minimum pixel value from the `base` and `active` matrices, mimicking the same functionality as your provided C++ `darken_blend_8` function.\n",
    "Here is python equivalent code using provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the given C++ code, for each pair of corresponding pixels in the two given images (as 2D vectors), the pixel with the lower intensity is selected. This corresponds to the `matrix_selection_two_args` function in your provided functions, with `select_two_args` defined to select the smaller of the two arguments.",
    "To represent `darken_blend_8` function in Python using the available defined functions, the code can be written like this:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, min)\n```\n\nBy using the `min` function as the `select_two_args_arg` argument for `matrix_selection_two_args` function, we achieve the equivalent behavior to the original function `darken_blend_8`.\n\nThe `min` function returns the argument with the minimum value, replicating the functionality of `if (base[row][col] > active[row][col]) pixel = active[row][col]; else pixel = base[row][col];` by selecting the smaller pixel- darken blend value between each correspondent pair of elements in `base` and `active`. Therefore, the Python function is semantically equivalent to the C++ function. \n\nNote: This function assumes that both, base and active are two-dimensionally aligned i.e., they have same shape, and contain integer values.",
    "Based on the provided code and functions, you can rewrite the C++ function into Python as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n```\nHere, the `darken_blend_8` function first applies the `matrix_selection_two_args` function on the base and active matrices. The function `matrix_selection_two_args` applies the `select_two_args` function to each corresponding pair of elements in the two matrices.\n\nThe `select_two_args` function takes two integers and returns the smaller one. This matches the behavior of the original C++ function, which selects the smaller of the base and active pixel values for each pixel in the output."
