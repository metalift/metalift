    "Given the function you provided, I guess you would like to translate the `lighten_blend_8` function in C++ into Python with the provided functions. Therefore, considering the function uses a max function inside a loop for matrices to compare each pixel from `base` and `active` and gets the max one, your required function `lighten_blend_8` can be implemented in Python using `matrix_selection_two_args` alongside with `max` function as `select_two_args_arg`. Here is the translated function:\n\n``` python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, max)\n```\n\nThis function will apply the max function on matching pairs of elements from `base` and `active` and create a new matrix with the maximum elements at their corresponding places. This new matrix would be equivalent to the `out` matrix in your C++ function.",
    "Based on your instructions, here's the Python implementation. I've defined the `lighten_blend_8` function that makes use of the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, and I've defined the selection function `select_two_args` to select the larger of the two arguments.\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThe `lighten_blend_8` function applies the selection operation element-wise on the matrices `base` and `active`. The selection operation checks if the element in the `base` matrix is less than the corresponding element in the `active` matrix, and if so, selects the element from the `active` matrix, otherwise it selects the element from the `base` matrix. The result is a new matrix that contains the maximum element-wise values between the `base` and `active` matrices.",
    "From the provided functions, it seems you want to convert the C++ code to Python. Using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function and a lambda function to convert the condition within the nested loops, the function becomes:\n\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, lambda int_x, int_y: int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x)\n```",
    "To rewrite the `lighten_blend_8` function in Python using the defined functions, you can use the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This function applies a specified `select_two_args_arg` function to each element of two input matrices `matrix_x` and `matrix_y`. Define the `select_two_args` function such that it chooses the maximum of its two integer inputs, `int_x` and `int_y`.\n\nHere's how you could rewrite it:\n\n```python\n# rewriting the lighten_blend_8 function\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n\n# defining the select_two_args helper function\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n```\n\nIn the light of provided function, this `lighten_blend_8` function is equivalent to `lighten_blend_8` function in C++. It applies the maximum operation for each pair of corresponding elements in the 'base' and 'active' matrices, returning a new matrix containing these maximum values.\n",
    "Here's how you can rewrite your `lighten_blend_8` C++ function using your defined functions in Python.\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n``` \n\nThe function `lighten_blend_8` makes use of the function `matrix_selection_two_args` by providing it with two matrices (`base` and `active`) and a function (`select_two_args`) to apply to every element. The function `select_two_args` simply returns the maximum of its inputs, which mimics the functionality of the C++ code."
