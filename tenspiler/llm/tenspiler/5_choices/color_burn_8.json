    "In Python, you can use the provided functions to implement the `color_burn_8` function as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import starmap\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else (255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x))\n\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    color_burn_8_rv = lambda x, y: select_two_args(x[0], y[0])\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, color_burn_8_rv)\n\n# removed: matrix_selection_two_args, select_two_args are already defined above\n```\n\nThe test function in C++ utilizes loops to iterate over the two input matrices simultaneously at each [row][col] location. It checks if the corresponding value at the location in active matrix is 0 and puts 255 in the output, else it performs a calculation involving both matrices and puts the result in output matrix.\n\nThe `color_burn_8` function in Python is trying to achieve the same thing using functionals instead of loops. For each pair of corresponding elements in the two input matrices, the `select_two_args` lambda is going to be called, which does the same check as the C++ code and returns the same calculated value or 255. This map operation is done using `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies a given function to each corresponding pair of elements in two matrices.\n\nPlease note, I have used integer division `//` instead of normal division `/` as this matches the semantics of the C++ implementation.",
    "Here is the python version of the given C++ function, re-written using the provided set of functions:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 0 else (255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x))\n```\n\nThe `color_burn_8` function is calling the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with inputs `base_matrix`, `active_matrix` and a function `select_two_args`. The `select_two_args` function mimics the inline calculations performed on each element in the C++ code. It takes in two elements `int_x` and `int_y` and returns either `255` or a calculated value based on the values of `int_x` and `int_y` just as in the original C++ function.\n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the given `select_two_args` function to each pair of elements in the two input matrices. This results in a new matrix with the same size as the input matrices, where each element is defined by applying `select_two_args` function to the corresponding elements in the input matrices.\nThe overall effect is that the Python function behaves in the same way as the given C++ function.\n \nNote: If calculations must result in integer as in C++ function, integer division `//` should be used in `select_two_args` function. If calculations must result in floating point number, normal division `/` can be used. Here, I have used integer division to keep it closer to the original C++ function.",
    "Based on the provided `test` function in C++, I have translated the function to Python using the predefined functions provided in the first section. \n\nIn Python, the function would be written as follows: \n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis function achieves the same results as the given `test` function in C++. The `select_two_args` function uses the same logic as the inner loop of the `test` function in C++, while the `matrix_selection_two_args` function replaces the outer loop.",
    "Based on the provided functions and the existing C++ function, we can rewrite the `test` function into Python like this:\n\n```python\n# select_two_args function definition\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    if int_x == 0:\n        return 255\n    else:\n        return 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n\n# color_burn_8 function definition using matrix_selection_two_args function from the toolkit\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nHere;\n\n- The equivalent of the for loop is handled by the `matrix_selection_two_args` function in the Python code, which takes a matrix and applies the `select_two_args` function to every pair of corresponding elements in the matrices `base` and `active`.\n\n- The `select_two_args` function in Python is equivalent to the if-else body inside the double for loop in the C++ code, for the calculation of pixel values. If the active pixel value is 0, we return 255; otherwise, we do the specified calculation. Division in Python with '//' returns an integer result, similar to what happens in C++.",
    "Based on the given C++ function and provided Python functions, we can translate the provided `color_burn_8` function from C++ to Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Defined Functions\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n``` \n\nThis Python function `color_burn_8` uses the given defined functions and implements the same operation as the original C++ `color_burn_8` function does. \n\nThe function `select_two_args(int_x, int_y)` is defined inline in the Python function `color_burn_8(base, active)`. It takes two arguments and returns the color-burned value of the base color `int_y` with the active color `int_x`.\n\nThe function `color_burn_8(base, active)` return the result of applying the function `select_two_args` to every pair of corresponding elements from `active` and `base` matrix by using the given function `matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_x, matrix_y, select_two_args_arg)` . The `matrix_selection_two_args` function is applying `select_two_args` to each pair of corresponding elements from `active` and `base` matrix. \n\nThis is semantically equivalent to the matrix operation observed in C++ code."
