    "Since the operations we need involve condition checks and randomness, they may not map directly to the functions given. The main operation is a pixel-wise operation, depending on the randomness and opacity value. Python, as a high-level language, does not support pixel level operations natively. However, we have operations for vector and matrix operations. For simulating randomness, the rand_cons representing the randomness can be made into a matrix of appropriate dimensions, to act as a randomness matrix. Also, similarly the opacity which is a scalar can also be made into a matrix of the same dimensions. Then we use the selection_two_args function for matching the if condition in the original C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function to get the desired output matrix.\n\nThe main challenge here is that we don't have a proper randomness function or a way to convert scalar into a matrix with given dimensions with provided set of functions. But if we somehow are able to get the opacity and rand_cons into matrix of desired dimensions, we can get our solution using matrix_selection_two_args. \n\nLet's assume that:\n1. `opacity_matrix` is a matrix with all elements equal to opacity and `rand_matrix` is a matrix with all elements equal to ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100, and\n2. `selection_two_args_arg` is a function which mimics the behaviour of if-else condition in C++ code.\n\nWith these assumptions, your function equivalent in python would be:\n```\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity_matrix, rand_matrix):\n    def select_two_args_arg(x, y):\n        return active[x][y] if opacity_matrix[x][y] - rand_matrix[x][y] >= 0 else base[x][y]\n\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(opacity_matrix, rand_matrix, select_two_args_arg)\n    return out\n```\n\nIn the above solution, we have abstracted the randomness and condition checking into a single function `select_two_args_arg`, which works with the `matrix_selection_two_args` provided earlier, to do selection operation conditionally on two matrices. \n\nPlease note that this translation is just a conceptual idea and needs to be implemented with exact data types and functionalities by further handling the randomness and scalar to matrix conversion. \n\nAlso, this may not be an optimal solution or may not produce the exact output as expected from C++ function, as high level languages like Python may handle the floating point calculations and roundings differently than C++. For more accurate translation, consider using more suitable Python libraries such as numpy, PIL/Pillow for image processing, which can provide direct functions for such pixel level processing.",
    "Based on the information given, here is a python program that rewrites the \"dissolve_blend_8\" function in C++ using the predefined set of functions and constants:\n\n```Python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda x, y: y if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0 else x,\n    )\n```\n\nThis new function \"dissolve_blend_8\" works similarly to the original C++ function. \"matrix_selection_two_args\" is a function similar to a double 'for' loop which iterates over every element of the 'base' and 'active' matrices. Then for each pair of corresponding elements in the 'base' and 'active' matrices, it applies a lambda function which behaves the same as the 'if' condition in the original C++ code. If 'opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100' is greater than or equal to 0, it returns the element from the 'active' matrix, else it returns the corresponding element from the 'base' matrix.\n",
    "The C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function performs image blending operation which takes the pixel from either the base image or active image layer based on the opacity difference and random value.\n\nWe can use functions listed above to rewrite this function in Python. Specifically, we can use matrix_selection_two_args function that takes base, active matrices (image layers) and a function that mimics the pixel selection based on their opacity and random number as arguments.\n\nPython equivalent of the `dissolve_blend_8` function is given below:\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\nHere, cons_rand should be a constant random value that will be used to calculate the rand_val which is used for checking opacity difference. This rand_val is used to transit between two images. If opacity is equal or greater than this value, it will choose pixel from active image layer, otherwise from base image layer.\n\nPlease note, these functions you provided (including matrix_selection_two_args) use the recursion. It might become a bottleneck for big images. This is just a direct translation from C++ code, in reality you might want to optimize this for better performance.",
    "You want to rewrite the `dissolve_blend_8` function from C++ to Python using the provided defined functions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_two_args(mat_x, mat_y):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        pixel = mat_x if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else mat_y\n        return pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis version of the `dissolve_blend_8` function does the same as the one implemented in C++ code: it takes four parameters - two matrices (`base` and `active`), an `opacity` value and a constant `rand_cons`. It returns a new matrix with the same dimensions as `base` and `active` where each element is either from `base` or `active` depending on the value of `opacity` and `rand_val`. Here the selection of the pixel value based on the comparison of `opacity` and `rand_val` is done inside the `select_two_args` function which is then used as an argument in `matrix_selection_two_args` to perform the operation on the entire matrices.",
    "You can rewrite the C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function using the previously defined functions in python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, \n                                    active,\n                                    lambda x, y: y if (opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100) >= 0 else x)\n    return out\n```\nIn this python function:\n\n- `matrix_selection_two_args` function is used to iterate over every element in the `base` and `active` matrices.\n- For each element, it checks if `opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100` is greater or equal to 0. If so, it selects the element from `active`, otherwise it selects the element from `base`.\n- The result is a new matrix with elements selected from `active` or `base` matrices based on the condition, which is equivalent to the behavior of `dissolve_blend_8` function in C++. \n\nNote: This python function is assuming that the `base` and `active` inputs are two-dimensional lists (matrices) of equal dimensions, and `opacity` and `rand_cons` are integers. Also, it is assuming that division by 100 is giving you a floating point number which is not the case in the C++ implementation given. In the C++ version it would always be integer division thus always yielding 0 unless `rand_cons % 100 + 1 == 100`. You might want to solve this issue according to the desired behavior. \n\nIf you want to replicate exactly the same behavior, you should cast the result to integer as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, \n                                    active,\n                                    lambda x, y: y if opacity - int((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100 >= 0 else x)\n    return out\n```"
