    "Here is the function `multiply_blend_8` rewritten using the provided functions.\n\n```Python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis function first performs an element-wise multiplication of the given matrices `base` and `active` using the `matrix_elemwise_mul` function. The result of the multiplication operation is then divided by 255 using the `matrix_scalar_div` function to normalize pixel values to the range [0, 255]. The function returns the resulting matrix. This is a common operation in image processing, particularly in blending two images together.",
    "Here is the equivalent Python rewrite of the multiply_blend_8 function, using the defined functions:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nWe use `matrix_scalar_div` with 255 as scalar and the result of `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)` as matrix. This is because each pixel in the given `test` C++ function is derived by multipling the corresponding elements in `base` and `active` and then dividing by 255.",
    "You can rewrite the `multiply_blend_8` function in Python with provided functions as:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nThe function combines two operations from the provided functions: `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)`, which computes the elementwise product of the two input matrices, and `matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))`, which then divides each element in the resulting matrix by 255. This is semantically equivalent to the original C++ function.",
    "Here is your requested rewrite:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n``` \n\nThis Python function `multiply_blend_8` uses the provided defined methods to replicate the behaviour of the given C++ function `multiply_blend_8`. It calculates per-pixel multiplication between two images (represented as 2D arrays of 8-bit integers) and divides the result by 255, effectively blending the images.",
    "The Python equivalent of the test function, using the provided functions, would be:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis Python function executes the same operations as the C++ function: it element-wise multiplies two matrices, `base` and `active` (equivalent to the inner loop of the original function), and then element-wise divides the result by `255` (equivalent to `/ 255` in the original function)."
