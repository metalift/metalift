    "Sure! The test function in your provided Python functions, would look something like this:\n\n```python\n\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active): \n    return matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```\nSo, according to the function definitions provided, `matrix_scalar_sub(a, matrix_x)` returns a matrix where `a` is subtracted from all elements of `matrix_x` and `matrix_elemwise_add(matrix_x, matrix_y)` returns a matrix formed by the element-wise addition of `matrix_x` and `matrix_y`. So `matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))` performs the operation equivalently to your original `linear_burn_8` C++ function.",
    "The `linear_burn_8` function can be rewritten using the provided functions as follows:\n```python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```\nWe used the `matrix_scalar_sub` and `matrix_elemwise_add` functions where the constant is 255 instead of 32, to ensure that their output matches the given C++ function in the `test` case. This function will subtract 255 from the element-wise summation of two 2D vectors `base` and `active`, exactly similar to the C++ function.",
    "Based on the provided C++ function `linear_burn_8`, the description, and understanding of the defined functions, the equivalent Python function in terms of the provided functions should look like this:\n```Python\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```\nIn both the C++ and the Python versions, the function performs an addition operation on the two input matrices using `matrix_elemwise_add` and afterwards subtracts the result from 255 using `matrix_scalar_sub`.",
    "In the given `test` C++ function `linear_burn_8` , the function takes two 2D vector inputs `base` and `active`. It goes through the vectors and for each pair of elements from `base` and `active` it sums them and subtracts 255 and the result is pushed into `out` 2D vector.\n\nGiven a set of Python functions, you can decompose and rewrite this `test` function to its Python equivalent `linear_burn_8_ps` as follows:\n\n```Python\ndef linear_burn_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```\nThe function `matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))` executes the summation operation between the elements of `base` and `active` vectors and subtracts 255 from each result element, which is equivalent to the operations performed in the original C++ function.",
    "The `linear_burn_8` function in the C++ code you shared is doing a linear burn operation on two matrices `base` and `active`. This operation is equivalent to adding the two matrices together and then subtracting 255 from the result, with the assumption that the matrices are (m x n), representing an image's pixel values (each in the range of 0 to 255).\n\nAccording to the manually written pseudocode function, we are subtracting 255 from the addition of two matrices `base` and `active`. The pseudocode says subtracting 32, but it's incorrect considering we must subtract 255 according to the C++ function. Here is the converted C++ `linear_burn_8` function.\n\n```python\n# Python function\ndef linear_burn_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_sub(255, matrix_elemwise_add(base, active))\n```  \n\nThis Python function `linear_burn_8` first adds the two input matrices `base` and `active` element-wise using the function `matrix_elemwise_add()`. Then it subtracts 255 from each element of the resulting matrix using the function `matrix_scalar_sub()`. The result is equivalent to the C++ `linear_burn_8` function."
