    "The `linear_dodge_8` function can be rewritten using the provided functions and constants as follows:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\n\nThe `linear_dodge_8` function essentially adds the corresponding elements of two matrices (2D lists) `base` and `active`. In our provided python functions, this is achieved using the `matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)` function which carries out element-wise addition of two matrices. This thus corresponds to the \"linear dodge\" operation being applied to the base and active matrices.",
    "Based on your description, you want to rewrite the C++ function using python and the provided set of functions. Here is how this could be done using the `matrix_elemwise_add` function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nThe `linear_dodge_8` function in python is semantically equivalent to the C++ version. It uses the `matrix_elemwise_add` function to add two matrices (or 2D vectors in C++) elementwise, which is the same as looping over each row and column to add each pixel as in the given C++ function.",
    "The equivalent Python function of the given C++ function using the provided primitive functions can be written as follows:\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nThe given C++ function is performing element-wise addition of two matrices (`base` and `active`) and the directly equivalent function in Python using the provided functions is `matrix_elemwise_add()`. The two functions are semantically equivalent.",
    "The equivalent Python implementation using the provided functions would be:\n```Python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```",
    "Assuming that the task only requires to rewrite a function in Python which is semantically equivalent to the C++ function `linear_dodge_8`, you can use the existing `matrix_elemwise_add` function described in your defined functions because this direct replacement gives the same results.\n\nHere is the equivalent python function:\n\n```python\ndef linear_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_add(base, active)\n```\nRemember the `matrix_elemwise_add` function takes two matrices (a list of lists in python) and returns their element-wise addition. So, the behavior of this Python function accurately matches the original C++ function `linear_dodge_8`. This C++ function takes two 2D vectors and returns a new 2D vector with each element being the sum of corresponding elements from the input vectors."
