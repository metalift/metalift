    "Here is the Python equivalent code using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) // 255)) - 255)\\\n    if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) // 255)\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `select_two_args` function recreates the similar mathematical operation as in the original code. The decision of which expression to use base on the value of pixel (`int_x`) is decided in this function. \n\nThen, `matrix_selection_two_args` function applies the `select_two_args` function on every element of the matrices by working in element wise manner.\n\nLastly, `overlay_blend_8` function calls the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `base` matrix as both the inputs and the `select_two_args` function as the function to apply on each element of the matrix. The output from this function is directly returned as the result.",
    "In Python, you can implement the `overlay_blend_8` function using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - ((2 * int_y * int_y) // 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 \\\n        else ((2 * int_y * int_x) // 255)\n\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\nThis Python implementation of the overlay blending uses the given set of Python functions to apply the blending operation to two matrices `base` and `active`.\n\nHere, the function `select_two_args` implements the blending operation for two integer values. This involves a condition check on `int_x` and arithmetic operations according to the condition. This function is then used to get the overlay blend of two matrices using the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args`.\n\nThe function `overlay_blend_8` takes two matrices as input and returns their overlay blend by calling `matrix_selection_two_args` with `base`, `base` (since the original C++ code operates only on the base), and the blending function `select_two_args` as arguments.\n\nPlease note, given `active` matrix is not used in original C++ code so it is not used in the Python implementation.",
    "Here is the rewrite of the given `test` C++ function.\n\nThe equivalent Python function is `overlay_blend_8_ps`. Python has many built-in functions that simplify mathematical and matrix operations. Here, the function `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to emulate the two nested loops in the C++ version. It works on two matrices and applies the `select_two_args` function, which implements the same logic as the if-else condition in the C++ version. It operates on the corresponding elements in the `base` matrix.\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255)\n```\n\nIn `overlay_blend_8_ps` function, matrices `base` are passed twice as per your provided C++ function. If necessary, you can pass different matrices or adjust the `select_two_args` function according to your needs. The `select_two_args` function successfully captures the logic for each pixel in your C++ function. It has a conditional operation that checks if `int_x` is greater than or equal to `128`. If it is, it performs the first operation, else, it returns the result of the second operation, which is equivalent to your original `if-else` logic in C++.",
    "Based on your request, the C++ function `overlay_blend_8` can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) / 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) / 255)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis function is equivalent to your given C++ `overlay_blend_8` function. The operation is performed for each pair of integers from two matching locations in the two input matrices. The output is a new matrix that contains the results of these operations.\n\nHowever, note that the provided Python functions follow a recursive style, which might lead to a maximum recursion depth exceeded error for big inputs. A more efficient way would involve rewriting these functions using iterative processing, but this is outside the scope of this task.\n",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the given `test` function with the usage of defined functions and constants:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x,int_y):\n        return ((((2 * int_x) + int_y) - (((2 * int_y) * int_y) // 255)) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else (((2 * int_y) * int_x) // 255)\n        \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the above Python function, matrix_selection_two_args is used to go through each element of the base matrix. For each pair of corresponding elements in the base matrices, the function select_two_args is applied. The selection_two_args has the logic to handle each pixel value that we do as in the `test` C++ function. \n\nIn the Python version, the `/` operator in the C++ version is replaced with `//` operator for floor division because in the C++ version we are working with integers, so it is appropriate to use floor division to get an integer result."
