    "You can achieve the C++ function's behavior in Python using the provided sets of functions. First, you need to generate a rand_val matrix; afterwards, you will use the matrix_selection_two_args function and provide a special function to operate between base and active elements.\n\nHere is the Python equivalent function:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    opacity_list = [[opacity]] * len(base)\n    rand_val = vec_map(opacity_list, lambda x: ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100)\n\n    def select_pixels(base_pixel, active_pixel, opacity_pixel, rand_val_pixel):\n        return active_pixel if opacity_pixel - rand_val_pixel >= 0 else base_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(\n        base,\n        active,\n        lambda base_row, active_row: selection_two_args(\n            base_row,\n            active_row,\n            lambda base_pixel, active_pixel: select_pixels(\n                base_pixel, active_pixel, opacity, rand_cons)\n            )\n        )\n```\nNote: This function expects matrices base and active to be lists of lists. The opacity and rand_cons constants are assumed to be positive integers. The rand_val is generated by mapping the opacity into a matrix with the same dimensions as the base matrix and then applying a specified function for all elements of the combined matrices. The select_pixels function is a helper function that takes the base and active pixels and applies the logic as per the C++ function. The matrix_selection_two_args is used to implement this logic over the entire set of matrices' elements. Finally, the selection_two_args function works on individual rows of the matrices.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the original function:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0])\n    out = []\n    for row in range(m):\n        row_vec = []\n        for col in range(n):\n            rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n            if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n                pixel = active[row][col]\n            else:\n                pixel = base[row][col]\n            row_vec.append(pixel)\n        out.append(row_vec)\n    return out\n```\n\nAnd here's the rewritten function using only provided utility functions:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_pixel(x, y):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return y if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```",
    "Here is a Python equivalent of your C++ function using the defined functions and their semantics, assuming that all arithmetic is integer based. We have a nested function which will implement the if condition in your loop, and we will pass this to the `matrix_selection_two_args` function.\n\nHere we also assume that `rand_cons` argument is a 2D list of random integer values with the same shape as the base and active matrix. This is because in C++, `rand()` function generates different random value each time it's called but in Python we need to pre-generate all the random values.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0]) if m > 0 else 0\n    \n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel, rand_val):\n        # We assume that rand_val is a value from 0 through 99 inclusive (like in your C++ program).\n        rand_val = (rand_val % 100 + 1) // 100\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return active_pixel\n        else:\n            return base_pixel\n\n    # We map select_pixel function into each cell in base, active, and rand_cons matrices\n    out = matrix_selection_three_args(base, active, rand_cons, select_pixel)\n    \n    return out\n```\n\nPlease note, the `matrix_selection_three_args` function not provided in the list of functions you gave, but it would logically follow as:\n```python\ndef matrix_selection_three_args(matrix_x, matrix_y, matrix_z, select_three_args_arg):\n    return (\n        []\n        if len(matrix_x) < 1 or not len(matrix_x) == len(matrix_y) == len(matrix_z)\n        else [\n            selection_three_args(matrix_x[0], matrix_y[0], matrix_z[0], select_three_args_arg),\n            *matrix_selection_three_args(matrix_x[1:], matrix_y[1:], matrix_z[1:], select_three_args_arg),\n        ]\n    )\n```\nAnd similarly for the `selection_three_args`:\n```python\ndef selection_three_args(x, y, z, select_three_args_arg):\n    return (\n        []\n        if len(x) < 1 or not len(x) == len(y) == len(z)\n        else [\n            select_three_args_arg(x[0], y[0], z[0]),\n            *selection_three_args(x[1:], y[1:], z[1:], select_three_args_arg),\n        ]\n    )\n```\nBut if the `rand_cons` is constant in nature then we will modify the `select_pixel` function to,\n```python\ndef select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n    # We assume that rand_cons is a value from 0 through 99 inclusive (like in your C++ program).\n    rand_val = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) // 100\n    if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n        return active_pixel\n    else:\n        return base_pixel\n\n```\nAnd then call the `matrix_selection_two_args` functions with these variables:\n```python\nout = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\nThese should provide the required logic for your problem.",
    "You can rewrite the given C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function as a Python function using the provided functions as below. The Python function provides the same functionality as of the C++ function using some helper functions.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    \n    def rand_val_fun(rand_cons):\n        return ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n\n    def pixel_select(base, active, rand_val, opacity):\n        if opacity - rand_val >= 0:\n            return active\n        else:\n            return base\n\n    def map_int_to_int(x):\n        return rand_val_fun(x)\n    \n    def select_two_args_arg(x, y):\n        return pixel_select(x, y, rand_val, opacity)\n\n    rand_val = rand_val_fun(rand_cons)\n    \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\nThis Python function will perform the same task as the C++ one. It takes two input matrices(`base` and `active`), `opacity` and 'rand_cons' as inputs and returns the output matrix as per the defined logic in the given C++ function `dissolve_blend_8`. \n\nNote: In Python, `//` is used for integer division while in C++, `/` is used for integer division, also, in Python, array indexing starts from 0.",
    "Here is how you can code the `dissolve_blend_8` function using only the given functions and constants in Python:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def pixel_select(pixel_base, pixel_active):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1.0) // 100\n        return pixel_active if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else pixel_base\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_select)\n```\n\nHere is a brief explanation of the function:\nThe `dissolve_blend_8` function takes in `base` and `active` (both are 2D arrays), `opacity` and `rand_cons` (constants). \n\nThe function `matrix_selection_two_args` maps across the elements of `base` and `active` simultaneously with the function `pixel_select`. \n\nThe function `pixel_select` takes a pixel from `base` and `active` and calculates `rand_val` from `rand_cons`. If `opacity` - `rand_val` is greater than or equal to 0, it returns the pixel from `active`, otherwise, it returns the pixel from `base`."
