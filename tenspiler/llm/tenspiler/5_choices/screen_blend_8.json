    "In Python, you can use the provided matrix computation functions to rewrite the given `test` function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(\n        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), \n        matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n    )\n```\n\nThis Python code substitutes the nested for-loop calculation in the original C++ function with a combination of matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication functions. The output will be a new matrix that is the result of the \"screen blend\" operation. This operation is commonly used in computer graphics and image processing.",
    "Sure, you can rewrite the C++ `screen_blend_8` function using the provided functions in Python like this:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(\n        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),\n        matrix_elemwise_div(\n            matrix_scalar_mul(255, base), active))\n```\nThis will behave the same as the original C++ function, it adds corresponding elements of `base` and `active`, then subtracts the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` divided by 255.",
    "Here is the equivalent python function for `screen_blend_8` using the provided built-in functions. The function name is `screen_blend_8_ps`, and it accepts two parameters, represent base and active respectively.\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\n\nThis `screen_blend_8_ps` function will perform the equivalent operations as the original C++ `screen_blend_8` function did using the given defined functions. The logic is the same: we add corresponding elements of base and active, then subtract the product of corresponding elements from the result, after scaling it by 255.",
    "Based on the comments, the semantically equivalent python code for the C++ function `screen_blend_8` mentioned in your question would look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\n\nThis Python function works by first adding the matrices `base` and `active` together element-wise. Then, it multiplies `base` and `active` together element-wise, divides each of those elements by 255, and subtracts these values from the result of the addition operation. This process is equivalent to the operations performed by the loop in the C++ `screen_blend_8` function. \n\nThe function `matrix_scalar_div` performs integer division, which is equivalent to the integer division in the C++ code. The inner loop of the C++ code is equivalent to the function `matrix_elemwise_add` and `matrix_elemwise_sub`. The outer loop is implemented implicitly by these functions' recursive calls to themselves on the tail of the input list, effectively iterating over the rows of the matrices.",
    "Based on the given functions, the `screen_blend_8` C++ function can be translated into Python as:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(\n        matrix_elemwise_add(base, active),\n        matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n    )\n```\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the C++ function, as it performs element-wise addition on the `base` and `active` matrix, element-wise multiplication on the `base` and `active` matrix, then scales the second result by dividing it by 255. The two results are then subtracted from each other element-wise."
