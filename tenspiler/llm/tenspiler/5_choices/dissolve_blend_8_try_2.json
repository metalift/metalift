    "Given the set of Python functions provided, the C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function could be translated into Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\nThis function performs the same logic as your original `dissolve_blend_8` function, using the equivalent functions provided. It iterates over the base and active matrices, and for each pair of corresponding pixels, it chooses either the active pixel or the base pixel based on a comparison of the opacity and a random value. This result is then stored in a new matrix, which is returned at the end.",
    "You can rewrite the `dissolve_blend_8` function in Python syntax using the supplied functions as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_pixel(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        rand_val = (rand_cons + 1) // 100\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matrix_selection_two_args()` function, which applies a function to each corresponding pair of elements from two 2D arrays. \n\nIn the function `select_pixel()`, we are applying the main logic of the `if` condition in the original C++ program. It's a simple function, but because Python doesn't have a ternary operator like C++, we're using an `if` expression (which is Python's equivalent) instead. We apply this function to every corresponding pair of elements from the `base` and `active` matrices, exactly as in the C++ version.",
    "You can rewrite the `dissolve_blend_8` function using the helper functions provided. In particular, the logic of the function can be rewritten using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, which takes two matrices and a function that act on each pair of corresponding entries from the two matrices.\n\nThe function `dissolve_blend_8` creates a new matrix where each entry is determined by comparing `opacity` with the `rand_val`: if `opacity - rand_val` is greater or equals to zero, the corresponding entry from `active` is selected, otherwise, the one from `base` is used. We can rewrite this logic in Python using lambdas. To get the `rand_val`, we can use definied `select_two_args_arg` as `lambda _, y: ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100`.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(matrix_base, matrix_active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_base, matrix_active,\n        lambda x, y: active[row][col] if opacity - ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100 >= 0 else base[row][col]\n    )\n```\n\nPlease note that using lambdas or any form of creating a subroutine is not directly possible with the given set of functions. Therefore, it's implicit that a function that compares `opacity` with `rand_val` is already defined for use in `matrix_selection_two_args`.",
    "The `dissolve_blend_8` function can be rewritten by using the provided python functions. Specifically, using `selection_two_args` inside the `matrix_selection_two_args` will enable to perform the nested if-else conditions thereby achieving a semantically equivalent Python code. The concept of blend operation used in the C++ function can be thought of as a selection operation, where depending on the random value a pixel is selected either from the base or the active vector.\n\nIt also uses an anonymous function (`lambda`) as the `select_two_args_arg` to encapsulate the logic inside the C++ function's if-else condition. \n\nHere is the equivalent Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom operator import ge\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base: List[List[int]], active: List[List[int]], opacity: int, rand_const: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    rand_val = rand_const % 100 + 1\n    select_two_args_arg = lambda x, y: y if ge(opacity, rand_val) else x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args_arg)\n```\nYou can define the Python version of the `dissolve_blend_8` function using the provided functions. As in the original C++ function, the Python version will use existing pixels in the base matrix if the opacity is less than the calculated random value, otherwise it will use the pixel value from the active matrix. The given opacity and random value determine which pixel (from base or active) to select.",
    "The C++ function `dissolve_blend_8()` can be rewritten in Python using the defined functions provided. The function loops over two 2D arrays (active and base) comparing element wise values with a certain condition, then storing the appropriate element in the new 2D array. \n\nThe `matrix_selection_two_args()` function can be used for this purpose, along with an inline function to perform the comparison. Let's define a Python function for this.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    rand_val = (rand_cons % 100 + 1) / 100\n    opacity -= rand_val\n    condition = lambda base_val, active_val: active_val if opacity >= 0 else base_val\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, condition)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `matrix_selection_two_args()` function is used to iterate over the 'base' and 'active' matrices element-wise. It takes three arguments, two matrices and a function to apply to each element of the same index in these two matrices.\n- A lambda function `condition` is used to compare each pixel in 'active' and 'base'. It takes in two arguments (the pixel values from 'base' and 'active') and returns 'active' if `opacity >= 0` else it returns 'base'.\n- The `rand_val` and `opacity` calculation are shifted above the function call considering they do not change per pixel."
