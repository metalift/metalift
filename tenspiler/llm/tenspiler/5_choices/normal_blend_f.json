    "The equivalent Python function using the pre-defined set of functions would look this way:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\nHere, we emulate the behavior of the original C++ function with the provided function set:\n\n- `vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active)` corresponds to `opacity * active[i]` in the C++ code, doing this operation for every `active[i]` and returning a list of results.\n  \n- Similarly, `vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base)` corresponds to `(1 - opacity) * base[i]` for every `base[i]`, returning a list of results.\n\n- Finally, `vec_elemwise_add` does the addition of corresponding elements from these two resulting lists, effectively implementing the `out.push_back(opacity * active[i] + (1 - opacity) * base[i]);` part of the C++ code by returning a list of the computed values.",
    "The `normal_blend_f` function in C++ can be rewritten in Python using the provided functions as follows:\n```\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul(1 - opacity, base))\n```\nThis function uses the provided `vec_elemwise_add` and `vec_scalar_mul` functions to add or multiply the elements of the two vectors 'base' and 'active' with the value of 'opacity' or '1 - opacity'. This is equivalent to the original C++ function, which has a loop traversing the 'base' vector and performing similar operations.",
    "Here is the Python equivalent of the provided C++ function, rewritten using the functions provided:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```",
    "You can certainly implement `normal_blend_f` function by using the provided functions. Here it is:\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```",
    "Here's the Python equivalent of your C++ function using the defined helper functions:\n\n```python\ndef normal_blend_f(base, active, opacity):\n    return vec_elemwise_add(vec_scalar_mul(opacity, active), vec_scalar_mul((1 - opacity), base))\n```\n\nThis function performs the same operation as the C++ version. It takes vectors `base` and `active` along with a scalar `opacity`, and it returns a new vector where each element is a combination of `opacity` times the corresponding element in `active` plus `(1 - opacity)` times the corresponding element in `base`. The operations are performed element-wise across the vectors."
