    "Your `color_dodge_8` function in python would be as follows:\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n```\nSince the test function involves integer division, I have used `//` operator for integer division. The python `//` operator will behave similar to `/` in C++, because `/` operator in c++ does integer division when both operands are integers.",
    "Sure, I can rewrite the function `color_dodge_8`. Here, the color dodge described in the C++ function is mapped to a python implementation using the available functions. We'll use `matrix_selection_two_args` function to process each pair of corresponding elements in both matrixes. Implement the `select_two_args` function to achieve the same logic in the inner loops of the original C++ function as well.\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nPlease note the use of integer division (`//`) instead of float division (`/`) because we intend to maintain the consistency with the original C++ program and also the provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` and `select_two_args` deal with integers only.",
    "You can rewrite your color_dodge_8 function in Python using the provided functions as so:\n\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n\n\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n```\n\nIn this code, `color_dodge_8` function takes in two parameters: `base` and `active` which are your original and active images respectively. This function then calls the `matrix_selection_two_args` function with `active`, `base`, and a custom function `select_two_args`  as arguments. \n\nThe `select_two_args` function mimics the if-else condition of the original C++ code. If the active image pixel value is 255, it returns 255 else, it divides the corresponding pixel value in the base image by `255 - active pixel value`, which is also the same calculation as the one in your original C++ code.\n\nThe returned output from `color_dodge_8` function will be the resultant image after the operation which should be semantically similar to your original C++ code. Since Python uses floor division when you use `//`, the results would be the same as in C++.",
    "To rewrite the given C++ function, we'll utilize the following Python functions defined above: `matrix_selection_two_args` and `selection_two_args`. We'll define the color_dodge_8 function to return the result from calling the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. This rewritten Python function will generate the same output as the original C++ test function.\n\nHere's the Python equivalent for your C++ function:\n\n```python\n#Helper Function\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n\n#Main Function\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn this rewrite, the `select_two_args` function is used to replicate the pixel calculation in your original C++ function and `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to iterate over each pixel in the input matrices, similar to the nested for loops in your original function.\n\nPlease note that, in Python, // operator is used for integer division because / operator results in a float value.",
    "Based on the given code, it looks like you are implementing a color dodge function which is a blending operation in digital image manipulation. This operation divides the bottom layer (base) by the inverted top layer (active) to lighten the bottom part.\n\nHere is how you can rewrite the `test` C++ function using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n    return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n\ndef color_dodge_8_ps(base, active):\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_two_args` function replicates the same functionality as in the `if` condition of your original C++ function. \n- The `color_dodge_8_ps` function, which is the Python equivalent of the C++ `color_dodge_8` function, applies the `select_two_args` function to each pixel of the `base` and `active` matrices using the `matrix_selection_two_args` function. \n\nNote: Given that Python does integer division using the `//` operator as it will automatically floor the result, which is identical to the behavior in C++. In this case, it ensures that the output pixel values remain as integers like in the C++ function."
