    "Sure, you can rewrite the `multiply_blend_8` function in C++ using the provided Python functions as follows:\n```\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nThis Python function uses `matrix_scalar_div` and `matrix_elemwise_mul` functions to divide the element-wise multiplication of `base` and `active` matrices by 255. The semantics of this function are equivalent to the given `multiply_blend_8` C++ function.",
    "The given `test` function in C++ is performing a per-pixel blending operation on two 2D images. First it element-wise multiplies the two input 2D matrices, \"base\" and \"active\", which represent images. Then, it scales the result by dividing each pixel by 255. \n\nHere is the function `multiply_blend_8` rewritten using the provided Python functions. The Python function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function.\n\nIn Python:\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nWe take advantage of the provided functions `matrix_scalar_div` and `matrix_elemwise_mul`. The `matrix_elemwise_mul` function is used to multiply the two input matrices on an element-by-element basis. Then, the `matrix_scalar_div` function is used to scale each element of the resulting matrix by dividing it by 255, which corresponds to the maximum value a `uint8_t` can hold, effectively normalizing the values.",
    "Here is the test function rewritten using the provided Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis Python function, `multiply_blend_8`, equivalent to the given C++ function `multiply_blend_8`, takes two arguments `base` and `active`, which are both multi-dimensional lists (matrices) of integers. The function applies an element-wise multiplication (`matrix_elemwise_mul`) to the two matrices `base` and `active`, and then divides the result by the scalar value `255` (`matrix_scalar_div`). The function returns a new matrix with this computation applied to every element.",
    "Based on the original C++ function named \"multiply_blend_8\", the equivalent Python function using provided functions can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nThis function performs element-wise multiplication between the `base` and `active` matrices by calling `matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)`. Then, it divides each element in the result matrix by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div(255, ...)`, which is equivalent to doing `(base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` for each pixel in the original C++ function.",
    "The equivalent Python function to your C++ function, using the provided helper functions could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nThis Python function takes two parameters `base` and `active`, which are lists of lists of numbers. It then calls the helper function `matrix_elemwise_mul` to get the elementwise multiplication of `base` and `active`. This results in a new matrix where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. \n\nThis result is then divided elementwise by 255 by calling the helper function `matrix_elemwise_div` with 255 as the first argument and the prior result as the second argument. This results in a new matrix where each element is the quotient of the corresponding elements in the prior result and 255.\n\nFinally, this resulting matrix is returned. \n\nIn your cpp code `base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` is equivalent to `matrix_elemwise_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))` in python code using provided functions. Notice that the division by 255 is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of 255, which is why the argument 255 is passed as the first argument to `matrix_elemwise_div`.\n\nPlease note that the equivalent python code may behave differently in terms of precision since division in python can yield float results. To have integer division in python, you would need to replace `/` with `//`. However, the function `matrix_elemwise_div` is already implementing integer division.",

Afterward, it performs dividen by 255 with each multiplication result using `matrix_elemwise_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))`, equivalent to `(base[row][col] * active[row][col]) / 255` in your C++ function.\n",
    "The provided C++ function multiply_blend_8 performs element-wise multiplication of two matrices followed by division of each element by a scalar value (255).

Then each element of the resulting matrix is divided by 255 using matrix_scalar_div function.",

The function is a semantically equivalent of the C++ version of the `multiply_blend_8` function you've provided.",
    "Given the C++ function multiply_blend_8 and the set of Python functions, the task is to develop a semantic equivalent of the multiply_blend_8 function in Python using the provided functions. Notice from the comment that there is a hint: \n```\n// def multiply_blend_8_ps(base active multiply_blend_8_rv)\n// multiply_blend_8_rv == matrix_scalar_div(32, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\nAlso, in the given C++ function, all multiplication of base and active for each of the elements are divided by 255. In Python, we can use `matrix_elemwise_mul` to perform the multiplication, then divide by 255 using `matrix_scalar_div`.

The two operations are achieved using `matrix_elemwise_mul` and `matrix_scalar_div` respectively."
