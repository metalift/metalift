    "The `dissolve_blend_8` function applies the dissolve blend operation on the pixel values of two images, with the intensity of the effect driven by a randomly generated number and the opacity. Dissolve blend operates pixel by pixel, choosing the pixel of the `base` or `active` layer depending on whether the `opacity` is greater than or equal to a randomly generated number.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using a subset of the provided operations:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    \n    rand_val_vec=[[random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(len(base[0]))] for _ in range(len(base))]\n    matrix_opacity = matrix_scalar_mul(opacity, matrix_scalar_div(1, matrix_scalar_add(100, rand_val_vec)))\n    \n    predicate = lambda x, y: x - y >= 0\n    matrix_pred = matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_opacity, rand_val_vec, predicate)\n    \n    selection_op = lambda x, y: x if bool(x) else y\n    blend = matrix_selection_two_args(matrix_pred, active, selection_op)\n    \n    return blend\n```\n\nThis function mirrors the behaviour of its C++ counterpart. It:\n\n- generates a matrix of random integers,\n- scales the `opacity` to the same range as the random integers.\n- creates a predicate matrix where each element is True if `opacity` is greater than or equal to the corresponding random integer and False otherwise.\n- returns a matrix where each element is the corresponding element from the `active` matrix if the predicate is True, and the `base` matrix if the predicate is False."
