    "The `multiply_blend_8` function is performing an element-wise multiplication on two 2D vectors (or matrixes) and then dividing each element by a scalar 255. \n\nHere's how to rewrite it in Python using the provided functions:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active))\n```\n\nAs the name suggests, `multiply_blend_8` evidently does a blending operation typically done on images, where `base` and `active` are image layers. Each element of the 2D matrix can be considered a pixel in the image. The pixels of two images are multiplied element-wise and then scaled down by dividing by 255 (maximum possible value for an 8-bit pixel). This kind of blending operation is common in computer graphics for applying various effects and filters."
