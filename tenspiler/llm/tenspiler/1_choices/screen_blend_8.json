    "We can rewrite the given `screen_blend_8` C++ function using your defined Python functions like so:\n\n```python\ndef screen_blend_8(base, active):\n    return matrix_elemwise_sub(matrix_elemwise_add(base, active), matrix_scalar_div(255, matrix_elemwise_mul(base, active)))\n```\n\nThis function is equivalent to the `screen_blend_8` C++ function. It uses your defined functions to perform matrix-wise operations, mirroring the operations performed per pixel in the original function: adding the two matrices (or images), multiplying them together and dividing by 255 before subtracting from the sum. The output will be a matrix (or image) that results from a screen blend operation on the base and active input matrices (or images)."
