    "Based on the C++ function, the objective is to generate the same functionality using Python and the set of provided functions. The function you are trying to mimic performs a so-called \"overlay blend\" on a two-dimensional array (in this case, a matrix of integers). \n\nFirst, you need to create the select_two_args function as a lambda function, then apply this function to the matrix of the base image using the matrix_selection_two_args function which applies select_two_args to each corresponding pair of cells in the two matrices. The answer is the following Python function:\n\n```python\ndef overlay_blend_8(base, active):\n    select_two_args = lambda int_x, int_y: ((2 * int_x + int_y - 2 * int_y * int_y // 255) - 255) if int_x >= 128 else ((2 * int_y * int_x) // 255)\n    overlay_blend_8_rv = matrix_selection_two_args(base, base, select_two_args)\n    return overlay_blend_8_rv\n```\n\nPlease note that due to integer division, the values computed in Python could be slightly different than the original C++ versions. If it is necessary to achieve exactly the same results, the division operation could be replaced by division with rounding as appropriate.\n\nA further note is that the \"active\" input is not used in the provided C++ function or in this Python function. If it was supposed to be used, please provide an updated C++ function and we can proceed from there."
