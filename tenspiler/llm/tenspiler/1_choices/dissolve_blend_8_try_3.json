    "Given the `dissolve_blend_8` function in C++, the equivalent function using the provided Python functions is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0])\n    rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n    \n    def pixel_selection(base_pixel, active_pixel):\n        return active_pixel if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_pixel\n    \n    out = matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, pixel_selection)        \n    return out\n```\nIn the C++ function, we loop over each pixel in two given matrices, compare the opacity with a calculated random value, and select the pixel from either the active or base matrix. The pixel (active or base) is then added to the output.\n\nThe Python equivalent uses a provided function `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies a given operation (in this case, the selection of the pixel from base or active matrix) element-wise to two matrices. The operation is done by the helper function `pixel_selection`, checking if `opacity - rand_val` is bigger or equal 0, if true it selects the active pixel otherwise it chooses the base pixel. Thus implementing the logic of the original function. Another difference is that percentages in Python are not integers, and division will result in a float, while in C++ integer division was used. So `rand_val` might need adjustment if you want to completely match the C++ logic."
