    "Here is the rewritten version of the C++ `color_burn_8` function using Python:\n\n```python\ndef color_burn_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 0 else 255 - ((255 - int_y) // int_x)\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n``` \n\nIn this rewritten function, we define a helper function `select_two_args` which is used by the `matrix_selection_two_args` method. The `select_two_args` helper function calculates the pixel value by dividing `(255 - base[row][col])` by `active[row][col]` if `active[row][col]` is not zero, otherwise it assigns `255` to the pixel. After calculating each pixel value, `matrix_selection_two_args` construct the new matrix out with all calculated pixel values. So this rewritten python version is equivalent to C++ `color_burn_8` function. \n\nThe // operator is used instead of / , this is because in C++, the result of an integer division is an integer, not a float. However, in Python, a / b always results in a float, even if a and b are both integers. Python has a separate operator for integer division (//), which behaves the same way as / does in C++ when given integer operands. This should be taken into account when converting code from C++ to Python.\n"
