    "Given your provided Python definitions for vector and matrix operations, as well as your C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function, here is a Python equivalent of the `dissolve_blend_8`.\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    def select_with_rand(base_elem, active_elem):\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) / 100\n        return active_elem if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else base_elem\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_with_rand)\n```\n\nIn this Python equivalent,\n- I've created an inner function `select_with_rand` that calculates `rand_val` and decides between the active layer and base layer pixel value based on the opacity and `rand_val`, and returns the decision.\n- I've used your provided function `matrix_selection_two_args` to apply `select_with_rand` on the corresponding elements of `base` and `active` two-dimension vectors or matrices."
