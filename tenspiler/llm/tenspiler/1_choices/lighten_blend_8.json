    "Your `lighten_blend_8` function in Python with the provided functions would be as follow :\n\n```python\ndef lighten_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x < int_y else int_x\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nIn C++ version, the `lighten_blend_8` function is creating a new matrix where an element is the maximum of correponding elements from input matrices `base` and `active`. The Python function does the same thing using `matrix_selection_two_args` and a helper function to select the maximum value. If `int_x < int_y` the function returns `int_y` (the maximum value). Otherwise, it returns `int_x`. This operation is mapped over all the elements of `base` and `active` matrices by the `matrix_selection_two_args` function, resulting in the same effect as in the original C++ function."
