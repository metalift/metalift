    "In Python, the `darken_blend_8` function and its helper function `select_two_args` should be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\ndef darken_blend_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return int_y if int_x > int_y else int_x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_two_args)\n```\n\nThis Python function is semantically equivalent to the given C++ function. It uses the provided `matrix_selection_two_args` function and a locally defined `select_two_args` function to achieve the same functionality as the original function. \n\nThe `select_two_args` function returns the smaller of the two input values, which is what the condition inside the loop in the original C++ function does. The `matrix_selection_two_args` function iterates over the two input matrices and applies the `select_two_args` function on each pair of corresponding elements. This does the same thing as the nested for loop in the original C++ function."
