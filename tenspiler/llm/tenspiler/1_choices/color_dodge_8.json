    "Sure, following is the Python equivalent of the given C++ function using the listed defined functions:\n```python\ndef color_dodge_8(base, active):\n    def select_two_args(int_x, int_y):\n        return 255 if int_x == 255 else (int_y // (255 - int_x))\n        \n    return matrix_selection_two_args(active, base, select_two_args)\n```\nIn this function, `select_two_args` is a local function that accepts two integer arguments and applies the operation as defined in your C++ `color_dodge_8` function. This function is then used as an argument in `matrix_selection_two_args`, which applies the `select_two_args` operation element-wise on the `base` and `active` matrices, recreating the logic of your original C++ program."
