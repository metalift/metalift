    "You can use your available functions to get the same result in Python as your C++ function. I'm assuming `opacity` and `rand_cons` are integers, as well as elements of `base` and `active` are integers too. The `rand_val` in Python needs to be an integer, so I'll use the integer division `//` instead of `/`. Here is the Python code that achieves the same as your C++ `dissolve_blend_8` function:\n\n```python\ndef dissolve_blend_8(base, active, opacity, rand_cons):\n    m = len(base)\n    n = len(base[0])\n \n    def select_pixel(x, y):\n    \t\"\"\"Helper function to compute pixel\"\"\"\n        rand_val = ((rand_cons % 100) + 1) // 100\n        return y if opacity - rand_val >= 0 else x\n\n    return matrix_selection_two_args(base, active, select_pixel)\n```\n\nHere, the `select_pixel` function is equivalent to the `if..else` condition inside the nested for loop in the C++ code. It gets the `pixel` by checking if `opacity - rand_val` is nonnegative and returns either `y` (element of `active`) or `x` (element of `base`).\n\nNext, `matrix_selection_two_args` is used to process every pair of corresponding elements in `base` and `active`. It applies `select_pixel` to these pairs and returns a new matrix. This matrix corresponds to the `out` array in your C++ code."
