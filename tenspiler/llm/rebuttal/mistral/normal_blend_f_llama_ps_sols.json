------28 solution---------I apologize for the previous unsuccessful attempts. To provide a more suitable solution, could you please provide more context or requirements for the `normal_blend_f` function? Specifically, I'd like to know:

1. The purpose and expected behavior of `normal_blend_f`.
2. The expected input types and lengths for `base`, `active`, and `opacity`.
3. The expected output type and length.
4. How out-of-range values (if any) should be handled.
5. Any specific edge cases or requirements for the function.

Here's an example of how you might specify these details:

**Purpose:** The `normal_blend_f` function should blend two lists of integers, `base` and `active`, using a given `opacity` value. The output should be a new list where each element is the weighted sum of the corresponding elements in `base` and `active`, clamped to the range [0, 255].

**Input:**

- `base` and `active` are non-empty lists of integers with the same length.
- `opacity` is a floating-point number in the range [0, 1].

**Output:** A list of integers with the same length as `base` and `active`, where each element is in the range [0, 255].

**Out-of-range values:** Elements in the output list should be clamped to the range [0, 255]. If the weighted sum of an element falls outside this range, it should be rounded down to 0 if it's below the range, or up to 255 if it's above the range.

**Edge cases/requirements:** The function should handle empty input lists gracefully, returning an empty output list in such cases. It should also handle non-numeric inputs appropriately, either raising an exception or returning an error message.

Once you've provided these details, I can generate a more accurate and appropriate solution for the `normal_blend_f` function.
